# ASI-Arch-Thoughtseeds: Current Status & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-22
**Context Window:** 100% Full - Switching Terminals

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **NumPy Compatibility Solution** - Constitutional framework established
2. **ThoughtSeed Service Integration (T022)** - Implemented and tested
3. **Consciousness Detection Pipeline (T023)** - Implemented and tested
4. **Affordance-Context Integration** - Implemented with Kiverstein, Scholz et al., and James integration
5. **Tutorial Documentation** - Created comprehensive tutorials with research citations
6. **Phase 3.4 Summary** - Documentation completed

### üîÑ In Progress
1. **Active Inference Service (T024)** - Implementation started but has import/dependency issues
2. **HRM Integration** - Hierarchical Reasoning Model principles being integrated
3. **Documentation** - Tutorial-style docs with research citations ongoing

### ‚è≥ Pending
1. **Episodic Memory Service (T025)** - Not yet started
2. **One-step Gradient Training** - Constitutional compliance implementation
3. **Adaptive Computation Time** - Consciousness reasoning optimization

## Current Issue: Active Inference Service (T024)

**Problem:** The ActiveInferenceService has import errors and missing dependencies when trying to run.

**Last Error:** 
```
python -m backend.services.active_inference_service
# ImportError: cannot import name 'AffordanceContextService' from 'backend.services.affordance_context_service'
```

**Root Cause:** The ActiveInferenceService is trying to import from a module that may not be properly structured or has circular import issues.

## Key Files Created/Modified

### Core Services

- `backend/services/consciousness_pipeline.py` ‚úÖ  
- `backend/services/affordance_context_service.py` ‚úÖ
- `backend/services/active_inference_service.py` üîÑ (needs fixes)

### Documentation
- `docs/tutorials/affordance_context_integration.md` ‚úÖ
- `docs/implementation_guides/active_inference_service_t024.md` ‚úÖ
- `PHASE_3_4_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` ‚úÖ

### Constitutional Framework

- `requirements-frozen.txt` ‚úÖ
- `constitutional_compliance_checker.py` ‚úÖ
- `setup_frozen_environment.sh` ‚úÖ

## Next Steps for New Terminal

### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix ActiveInferenceService Import Issues**
   - Check import structure in `backend/services/active_inference_service.py`
   - Ensure proper module initialization
   - Test the service independently

2. **Complete T024 Implementation**
   - Finish ActiveInferenceService with HRM integration
   - Add one-step gradient approximation
   - Integrate with AffordanceContextService

3. **Test Integration**
   - Create comprehensive test for ActiveInferenceService
   - Verify integration with existing services
   - Run full system integration test

### Secondary Tasks
1. **Episodic Memory Service (T025)**
   - Design and implement episodic memory system
   - Integrate with consciousness detection pipeline

2. **Constitutional Compliance**
   - Implement one-step gradient training
   - Add adaptive computation time features

## Database Structure Note

**Important:** User mentioned "DAedalu sin dionysus consciousnes project has the current model for the hybrid database structur Icreated"

This suggests there's an existing database structure in the Dionysus project that should be examined and potentially integrated or referenced for the ASI-Arch-Thoughtseeds project.

**Action Needed:** Investigate the Dionysus project's database structure to understand:
- Current hybrid database model
- How it relates to consciousness detection
- Whether it should be integrated into ASI-Arch-Thoughtseeds

## Research Integration Status

### Successfully Integrated
- **Julian Kiverstein** - Ecological-enactive cognition principles
- **Scholz et al.** - Affordance maps and active inference architecture
- **Mark M. James** - "Enhabiting" theory and sense-making frames
- **Friston et al.** - Dopamine, affordance, and active inference

### Documentation Created
- Comprehensive tutorials with proper citations
- Implementation guides linking theory to code
- Attribution to Mark M. James as requested

## Environment Status

- **Constitutional Framework:** ‚úÖ Established
- **Frozen Dependencies:** ‚úÖ requirements-frozen.txt created
- **NumPy Compatibility:** ‚úÖ Solution implemented
- **Docker Services:** ‚ö†Ô∏è May need restart (was showing errors earlier)

## Files to Review in New Terminal

1. `backend/services/active_inference_service.py` - Fix import issues
2. `backend/services/affordance_context_service.py` - Verify structure
3. `test_asi_arch_integration.py` - Update for new services
4. `system_status.json` - Check current system health
5. Dionysus project database structure - Investigate integration

## Quick Start Commands for New Terminal

```bash
# Check system status
python system_status.py

# Test current services
python test_asi_arch_integration.py

# Fix ActiveInferenceService
python -m backend.services.active_inference_service

# Run constitutional compliance check
python constitutional_compliance_checker.py
```

## Context Preservation

This document captures the current state at 100% context window. The next terminal session should:

1. Read this status document first
2. Focus on fixing the ActiveInferenceService import issues
3. Complete the T024 implementation
4. Investigate Dionysus database structure
5. Continue with T025 (Episodic Memory Service)

The project is well-positioned with strong theoretical foundations and most core services implemented. The main blocker is the ActiveInferenceService import/dependency issue that needs immediate attention.
