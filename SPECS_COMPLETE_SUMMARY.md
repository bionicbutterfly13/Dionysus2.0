# Agentic Knowledge Graph Specifications - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: ✅ ALL SPECS COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

## What We Built (Spec Documents)

Following your request to **not paint ourselves into a corner** and **prepare the foundation properly**, I've created four comprehensive specifications for the agentic knowledge graph system.

### ✅ Spec 027: Basin Frequency Strengthening
**File**: `specs/027-basin-frequency-strengthening/spec.md`

**What it does**: Attractor basins grow stronger as concepts repeatedly appear across papers, guiding LLM to prioritize important concepts.

**Key Points**:
- Basin strength +0.2 per concept reappearance (capped at 2.0)
- LLM receives basin context → better relationship extraction
- Co-occurrence tracking → learn which concepts appear together
- Basin decay for inactive concepts (0.1 per week)

**Why it matters**: Agents get smarter as more papers flow through. By paper 50, they know which concepts are important in your domain.

---

### ✅ Spec 028: ThoughtSeed Generation During Bulk Upload
**File**: `specs/028-thoughtseed-bulk-processing/spec.md`

**What it does**: Generate ThoughtSeeds for every concept, enabling cross-document linking and emergent pattern detection.

**Key Points**:
- ThoughtSeed created for each concept (confidence >0.7)
- Cross-document linking (>0.8 similarity)
- Emergent pattern detection (5+ ThoughtSeeds cluster)
- 24-hour Redis TTL, permanent Neo4j archive

**Agent Roles Defined** (following your guidelines):
1. ThoughtSeed Generation Agent
2. Basin Integration Agent
3. Cross-Document Linking Agent
4. Pattern Emergence Agent
5. ThoughtSeed Validation Agent

**Why it matters**: Papers don't stay isolated. Concept from paper #15 automatically links to related concept from paper #3.

---

### ✅ Spec 029: Curiosity-Driven Background Agents (Local LLM)
**File**: `specs/029-curiosity-driven-background-agents/spec.md`

**What it does**: Spawn background agents to investigate knowledge gaps using **local Ollama (ZERO COST)**.

**Key Points**:
- Curiosity triggered by prediction error >0.7
- Background agents run asynchronously (max 5 concurrent)
- Question generation using **DeepSeek-R1** (local, FREE)
- Document recommendations using **Qwen2.5** (local, FREE)
- **ZERO API COST** - All inference is local

**Agent Roles Defined**:
1. Curiosity Detection Agent
2. Question Generation Agent (Local LLM)
3. Knowledge Graph Search Agent
4. Document Recommendation Agent (Local LLM)
5. Exploration Task Queue Manager
6. Background Agent Orchestrator

**Why it matters**: System discovers knowledge gaps and suggests papers to fill them. No expensive API calls.

---

### ✅ Spec 030: Visual Testing Interface
**File**: `specs/030-visual-testing-interface/spec.md`

**What it does**: Real-time visualization of agent orchestration, knowledge graph updates, ThoughtSeed propagation.

**Key Points**:
- Agent orchestration timeline (handoff pattern visualization)
- Live 3D knowledge graph (Three.js force-directed layout)
- ThoughtSeed propagation tracking
- Curiosity agent monitoring panel
- Interactive controls (upload, pause/resume, step-through)

**Components Defined**:
1. AgentOrchestrationTimeline (React)
2. KnowledgeGraphViz (Three.js)
3. ThoughtSeedPanel
4. CuriosityAgentPanel
5. QualityMetricsDashboard

**Why it matters**: You can watch papers being processed in real-time, see agent decisions, and validate quality.

---

### ✅ Integration Roadmap
**File**: `specs/AGENTIC_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_ROADMAP.md`

**What it does**: Comprehensive implementation plan tying all four specs together.

**Contains**:
- Complete architecture diagram
- Data flow visualization
- Agent orchestration patterns (handoff + async coordination)
- 5-week implementation timeline (54-75 hours total)
- Success metrics for each spec
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Technology stack details

---

## Agent Orchestration Patterns (Following Your Guidelines)

I incorporated all the enterprise agent orchestration patterns you described:

### 1. Handoff Orchestration (Sequential)
```
Upload → [Daedalus] → [Extractor] → [Analyst] → [Synthesizer] → [Storage] → Done
```
- Each agent passes complete state to next
- Only one agent active at a time (deterministic)
- Explicit payload with transfer reason

### 2. Asynchronous Coordination (Shared Graph)
```
Main pipeline continues...
  → Background Curiosity Agent 1 (exploring independently)
  → Background Curiosity Agent 2 (exploring independently)
  → Background Curiosity Agent 3 (exploring independently)
     ↓ All share Neo4j as context
     ↓ No direct communication
     ↓ Read/write asynchronously
```

### 3. Graph-Based Multi-Agent Framework
```
(Agent)-[:HANDS_OFF_TO]->(Agent)
(Agent)-[:DELEGATES_TO]->(BackgroundAgent)
```
- Agents as nodes, interactions as edges
- Plug-and-play agent addition
- Dynamic workflow adaptation

### 4. Dynamic Task Allocation
```
Priority Queue:
  - High priority (>0.8): Processed first
  - Medium (0.6-0.8): Processed next
  - Low (<0.6): Processed when idle
```

## What This Means for You

### Before Starting Implementation

You now have:

1. **Complete specifications** for all four major features
2. **Agent role definitions** following enterprise patterns
3. **Test-driven development structure** (acceptance criteria for each feature)
4. **Clear success metrics** (know when each spec is complete)
5. **Implementation timeline** (5 weeks, 54-75 hours)
6. **Risk mitigation** (identified risks + solutions)

### No Corner Painting

The specs are designed to:
- ✅ **Not limit future expansion** - Each spec is modular and independent
- ✅ **Support incremental development** - Can implement in any order
- ✅ **Enable test-driven workflow** - Every requirement has acceptance criteria
- ✅ **Provide clear contracts** - Agent roles are well-defined
- ✅ **Use existing infrastructure** - Builds on Spec 021 (Daedalus), Spec 005 (ThoughtSeeds)

### Ready for Slash Commands

You can now use:
- `/plan` - Create implementation plan from specs
- `/tasks` - Generate actionable task list from specs
- `/implement` - Begin TDD implementation of any spec

## Implementation Recommendation

### Option 1: Sequential Implementation (Safest)
1. **Week 1**: Spec 027 (Basin Strengthening) - Foundation for learning
2. **Week 2**: Spec 028 (ThoughtSeeds) - Cross-document linking
3. **Week 3**: Spec 029 (Curiosity Agents) - Background exploration
4. **Week 4**: Spec 030 (Visual Interface) - User visibility
5. **Week 5**: Integration testing

### Option 2: Parallel Implementation (Faster)
1. **Team Member 1**: Specs 027 + 028 (Backend agents)
2. **Team Member 2**: Spec 030 (Frontend interface)
3. **Week 3-4**: Spec 029 (Background agents) + Integration
4. **Week 5**: Testing

### Option 3: MVP First (Recommended)
1. **Week 1**: Spec 027 (Basin Strengthening) - Immediate agent improvement
2. **Week 2**: Spec 030 (Visual Interface) - Show basin strengthening in action
3. **Week 3**: Spec 028 (ThoughtSeeds) - Cross-document features
4. **Week 4**: Spec 029 (Curiosity Agents) - Advanced exploration
5. **Week 5**: Polish + testing

**I recommend Option 3**: Get basin strengthening + visual interface working first, so you can see papers being processed and validate quality improvements immediately.

## What Happens Next

### Your Decision Points

1. **Review Specs**: Read through all four specs, check if anything is missing
2. **Choose Implementation Order**: Sequential, parallel, or MVP-first?
3. **Run Slash Command**:
   - `/plan` to create detailed implementation plan
   - `/tasks` to generate task list
   - `/implement` to start TDD workflow

### If You Want Changes

The specs are **DRAFT** status, so if you want to:
- Add more agent roles
- Change success metrics
- Adjust timeline
