## üîÑ Step-by-Step Information Flow (Current System)

Let me walk you through **exactly how information flows** through our system right now:

### Step 1: Information Entry Point
**What Happens**: Architecture evaluation data enters the system
```python
# Current Input Format
architecture_evaluation = {
    'eval_id': 42,
    'performance': 0.85,
    'architecture_type': 'transformer',
    'parameters': {'layers': 12, 'attention_heads': 8},
    'timestamp': '2025-09-22T10:00:00Z'
}
```

**Processing**: Raw evaluation data is validated and structured

### Step 2: Episode Boundary Analysis
**What Happens**: System analyzes sequence of evaluations to detect natural episode boundaries

**How It Works**:
1. `EpisodeBoundaryDetector` examines evaluation sequence
2. Looks for performance shifts (>20% change)
3. Detects architectural pattern changes (transformer ‚Üí CNN)
4. Identifies phase transitions (exploration ‚Üí exploitation)

**Output**: List of boundary positions `[5, 15, 28]` indicating episode breaks

### Step 3: Episode Generation
**What Happens**: Each segment between boundaries becomes a coherent episode

**Processing Steps**:
1. `ArchitectureEpisodeGenerator` analyzes segment
2. Extracts key patterns, performance trajectory, breakthroughs
3. Generates human-readable narrative
4. Associates with archetypal pattern if applicable

**Output**: `ArchitectureEpisode` with narrative like:
> "During evaluations 5-15, the architecture search explored diverse transformer patterns. Performance improved significantly from 0.72 to 0.85. Key breakthroughs included attention mechanism optimization."

### Step 4: Memory Storage
**What Happens**: Episodes are stored in episodic memory system

**Storage Process**:
1. Episode converted to BM25-searchable text
2. Context embeddings generated for retrieval
3. Stored in `DifferentiableNeuralDictionary`
4. Associated with archetypal patterns and metadata

### Step 5: Retrieval and Integration
**What Happens**: When similar contexts arise, relevant episodes are retrieved

**Retrieval Process**:
1. Query context compared with stored episode contexts
2. BM25 ranking identifies most relevant episodes
3. `ReinstatementGates` determine how to integrate retrieved memory
4. Memory integrated with current processing state
