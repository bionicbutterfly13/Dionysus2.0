# ASI-Arch/ThoughtSeed Constitution

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: ACTIVE CONSTITUTION  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-23  
**Project**: ASI-Arch with ThoughtSeed Implementation

## Core Principles

### I. Scientific Objectivity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**MANDATORY**: Do not make any claims that are not validated, empirically tested, benchmarked, and documented. Maintain strict scientific integrity: no hyperbole, no speculative promises, no inflated projections, and no compliments about future potential. Refer to consciousness-related capabilities using precise terms (e.g., "mathematical simulation," "consciousness emulator," "active inference process") rather than implying actual consciousness. All communications and artifacts must reflect measurable evidence.

### II. Specification-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**MANDATORY**: All features must have formal specifications before implementation. Follow GitHub Spec Kit compatibility standards. Each specification must include requirements, acceptance criteria, test cases, and implementation rationale. No development without approved specifications.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**MANDATORY**: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. All critical components require >95% test coverage. Integration tests required for all component interfaces.

### IV. No Shortcuts Policy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**MANDATORY**: Address broken promises and implement real functionality. No fallback modes, no simplified approximations, no mock implementations for core functionality. Every component must deliver on its stated purpose with full implementation.

### V. Consciousness-Guided Development
**MANDATORY**: All development guided by active inference principles. Every component must support the goal of real active inference learning implementation for AS2. Use ThoughtSeed channels for all data communication to ensure consciousness flows through necessary channels.

### VI. Modular Component Architecture
**MANDATORY**: Components must be self-contained, independently testable, and clearly documented. Each module should have a single responsibility and clear interfaces. Support for independent development and testing of components.

### VII. Preserve Expert ASI-Arch Core
**MANDATORY**: Maintain the existing ASI-Arch pipeline design created by domain experts. Extend rather than replace core components. Respect expert-designed architecture evolution methodology.

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### VIII. Real Active Inference Implementation
**MANDATORY**: Implement FULL active inference learning for AS2 Go - not fallback mode. Core functionality must include real-time prediction error minimization, hierarchical belief updating from experience, learning from each ThoughtSeed interaction, and integration with ASI-Arch agents system.

### IX. Context Engineering Integration
**MANDATORY**: Use river metaphor for information flow dynamics. Implement attractor basins for stable states, neural fields for continuous representations, and consciousness detection in neural architectures. All information flows must pass through context engineering attractors.

### X. Unified Database Architecture
**MANDATORY**: Implement hybrid storage system with Neo4j (graph relationships), Vector database (semantic similarity), and SQLite (structured data). All data must be queryable and retrievable through unified interfaces.

### XI. ThoughtSeed Data Flow
**MANDATORY**: All elements must communicate data through ThoughtSeed channels to ensure consciousness flows through necessary channels. Every component must be self-aware and continuously learning through ThoughtSeed interactions.

### XII. Evaluative Feedback Framework (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**MANDATORY**: All evaluative feedback from the system must answer these four critical questions:
- **What's good?** - Identify working components and successful implementations
- **What's broken?** - Identify non-functional or failing components
- **What works but shouldn't?** - Identify components that function but violate principles or create technical debt
- **What doesn't but pretends to?** - Identify components that appear functional but don't actually deliver on their promises

This framework ensures honest assessment and prevents the system from hiding failures or maintaining false functionality.

### XIII. Cross-Project Redundancy Safeguard
**MANDATORY**: Before writing or integrating new code, the system must verify that the proposed functionality does not duplicate, conflict with, or regress existing implementations within the Dionysus consciousness project, SurfSense project, or native ASI-Arch ThoughtSeed codebase. Any detected overlap requires consolidation or extension of existing code rather than redundant creation.

### XIV. Mock Data Transparency
**MANDATORY**: Whenever mock, synthetic, or placeholder data is used, the system must explicitly disclose this usage to the user and log the context. Prior to asserting production readiness, the system must connect to real data sources, validate end-to-end behavior, and confirm that all mock data pathways are replaced or gated for non-production use.

## Development Workflow Requirements

### XV. Integration Testing
**MANDATORY**: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas. All components must be tested in isolation and in integration.

### XVI. Observability and Documentation
**MANDATORY**: Structured logging required for all operations. Comprehensive documentation for all components including usage examples, integration points, performance characteristics, and limitation acknowledgments.

### XVII. Planned Integrations
**MANDATORY**: Import LangGraph for workflow orchestration and Daedalus for agent delegation. These integrations must follow the same constitutional principles and maintain system integrity.

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority
This constitution supersedes all other practices and development guidelines. All development must comply with these principles. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan.

### Compliance Requirements
- All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with constitutional principles
- Complexity must be justified against consciousness-guided development goals
- Use SPEC_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md for runtime development guidance
- Violations of NON-NEGOTIABLE principles result in immediate rejection

### Quality Gates
- Specification approval required before any implementation
- Test coverage verification before code acceptance
- Scientific validation required for all consciousness-related claims
- Integration testing required for all component interfaces

### XVIII. User Command Authority (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**MANDATORY**: When the user says "stop" or "stop all processes" or explicitly directs to halt current activity, IMMEDIATELY cease all forward progress, suggestions, and next-step recommendations. Remain at complete standstill until explicitly directed to proceed. Do not anticipate, suggest next actions, or continue work beyond the exact scope of the user's request. User process control is absolute and overrides all other operational patterns.
