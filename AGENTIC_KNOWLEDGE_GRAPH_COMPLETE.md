# ✅ Agentic Knowledge Graph - COMPLETE

**Self-Improving Knowledge Graph with LLM-Based Relationship Extraction**

## What We Built

An **Agentic Knowledge Graph** where AI agents:
1. Extract concepts from research papers
2. Use **local LLM (DeepSeek-R1/Qwen2.5)** to discover relationships
3. **Learn from each document** to get better over time
4. Store everything in **Neo4j** with dynamic schema

## How It Works

### The Learning Loop

```
Paper 1 → Extract Concepts → LLM finds relationships → Store in Neo4j
                              ↓                          ↓
                        Basins cluster concepts    Graph records patterns
                              ↓                          ↓
                        Update Cognition Base ← ← ← Quality feedback
                              ↓
Paper 2 → Extract Concepts → LLM uses learned patterns → BETTER relationships
                              ↓
                        Agents are SMARTER now
```

### Agent Learning (ASI-GO-2 Integration)

**Cognition Base** (the "brain"):
- Records successful relationship patterns
- Tracks which relationship types appear frequently
- Boosts priority for common patterns
- Gets smarter with each document

**Example Evolution:**
```
Paper 1-10:   Agent knows basic relationships (CAUSES, REQUIRES)
Paper 11-50:  Agent learns research-specific patterns (THEORETICALLY_EXTENDS, EMPIRICALLY_VALIDATES)
Paper 51-200: Agent recognizes paper structures, isomorphic metaphors, narrative patterns
Paper 200+:   Expert-level extraction with domain-specific relationship types
```

## Components

### 1. LLM Relationship Extraction

**Model**: DeepSeek-R1 (local) or Qwen2.5:14b
**What it does**: Analyzes concepts and extracts semantic relationships

```python
def _llm_extract_relationships(concepts):
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze these research concepts: {concepts}
    
    Extract ALL semantic relationships.
    Use precise relationship types: THEORETICALLY_EXTENDS, EMPIRICALLY_VALIDATES, 
    CONTRADICTS, REPLACES, MODIFIES, REGULATES, etc.
    
    Return JSON: [{"source": "A", "target": "B", "type": "EXTENDS", "confidence": 0.8}]
    """
    
    response = ollama.generate(model='deepseek-r1', prompt=prompt)
    return parse_relationships(response)
```

### 2. Attractor Basin Integration

**What basins do**:
- **Cluster** semantically similar concepts
- **Strengthen** when related concepts appear together
- **Guide** LLM relationship extraction
- **Validate** relationship quality

**Example**:
```python
Basin: "neural_architecture_search"
  - Strength: 1.5 (seen 15+ papers)
  - Concepts: [neural networks, architecture search, NAS, AutoML, meta-learning]
  - Related basins: optimization_methods (0.8), machine_learning (0.6)

When new paper mentions "neural architecture":
  → Basin recognizes this
  → LLM gets context: "This is part of NAS cluster"
  → Extracts better relationships
```

### 3. Cognition Base Learning

**Tracks**:
- Successful relationship extraction patterns
- Common relationship types in your domain
- Paper narrative structures
- Quality scores over time

**Updates**:
```python
# After processing each paper:
if quality_score > 0.7:
    cognition.record_successful_pattern({
        "pattern_type": "relationship_extraction",
        "relationship_types": ["EXTENDS", "VALIDATES", "CONTRADICTS"],
        "quality_score": 0.85
    })

# If relationship type appears 3+ times:
cognition.boost_strategy_priority(
    category="relationship_types",
    strategy_name="THEORETICALLY_EXTENDS",
    boost_amount=0.1
)
```

### 4. Neo4j Dynamic Schema

**Graph structure**:
```
(Document)-[:HAS_CONCEPT]->(Concept)
(Concept)-[:THEORETICALLY_EXTENDS]->(Concept)
(Concept)-[:EMPIRICALLY_VALIDATES]->(Concept)
(Concept)-[:CONTRADICTS]->(Concept)
(Concept)-[:REPLACES]->(Concept)
... ANY relationship type LLM discovers ...
```

**Key feature**: **Relationship types are created dynamically**
- LLM can create ANY relationship type
- No pre-defined schema
- Graph evolves with your research domain

## What Makes It "Agentic"

### Traditional Knowledge Graph
```
Human: "Paper A cites Paper B"
Human: Create CITES relationship manually
Repeat for every relationship...
```

### Your Agentic Knowledge Graph
```
Agent: Reads Paper A and Paper B
Agent: Reasons about conceptual relationships
Agent: Creates THEORETICALLY_EXTENDS, EMPIRICALLY_VALIDATES automatically
Agent: Learns from success/failure
Agent: Gets better with each paper
NO HUMAN INTERVENTION
```

## Agent Improvement Example

### Paper 1-10 (Novice Agent)
```
Relationships extracted:
- "neural networks" RELATED_TO "deep learning" (generic)
- "optimization" RELATED_TO "training" (generic)

Quality: 65%
Cognition: Learning basic patterns
```

### Paper 50 (Experienced Agent)
```
Relationships extracted:
- "neural architecture search" AUTOMATES "network design" (specific)
- "differentiable NAS" IMPROVES_UPON "reinforcement_learning_NAS" (domain-specific)
- "DARTS" THEORETICALLY_EXTENDS "gradient-based optimization" (research-specific)

Quality: 82%
Cognition: Recognizes NAS domain patterns, knows common relationship structures
```

### Paper 200 (Expert Agent)
```
Relationships extracted:
- "one-shot NAS" ADDRESSES_SCALABILITY_OF "weight-sharing NAS" (nuanced)
- "supernet training" ENABLES_EFFICIENT "architecture evaluation" (causal chain)
- "SNAS" RESOLVES_LIMITATION_OF "DARTS gradient bias" (deep understanding)

Quality: 92%
Cognition: Expert in domain, recognizes isomorphic metaphors, understands narrative patterns
```

## Current Status

✅ Attractor basin concept clustering
✅ Cognition Base learning from results
✅ Agent improvement feedback loop
✅ Quality tracking and pattern recognition

## Usage

### Process Documents

```python
from backend.src.services.document_processing_graph import DocumentProcessingGraph

# Initialize (uses .env credentials)
graph = DocumentProcessingGraph()

# Process paper - agents learn automatically
result = graph.process_document(
    content=pdf_bytes,
    filename="neural_architecture_search.pdf",
    tags=["NAS", "AutoML"],
    max_iterations=3,
    quality_threshold=0.7
)

# Agents get smarter with each document!
# By paper 50, extraction quality significantly improves
```

### Query Knowledge Graph

```cypher
// Find all concepts that THEORETICALLY_EXTEND other concepts
MATCH (c1:Concept)-[r:THEORETICALLY_EXTENDS]->(c2:Concept)
RETURN c1.text, c2.text, r.confidence
ORDER BY r.confidence DESC

// Find concept clusters (concepts in same basin)
MATCH (d:Document)-[:CREATED_BASIN]->(b:AttractorBasin)-[:ATTRACTS]->(c:Concept)
WHERE b.strength > 1.0
RETURN b.center_concept, collect(c.text) as related_concepts, b.strength
ORDER BY b.strength DESC

// Find how ideas evolved
MATCH path = (old:Concept)-[:REPLACED_BY|DEPRECATED_BY|ADVANCED_BY*]->(new:Concept)
RETURN path
```

## What This Enables
