# Spec 032: Emergent Pattern Detection - Complete Summary

**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE with Provenance & Trust Signals

## What This Spec Adds

Following your research on **emergent phenomena in agentic knowledge graphs**, **real-time entity detection**, and **provenance/trust signals**, I've created a comprehensive specification for autonomous pattern detection and entity evolution tracking.

## The Three Research Foundations

### 1. Emergent Phenomena Capture (Your First Research)
**Key Insight**: "Agentic knowledge graphs capture emergence through iterative agent reasoning, composition, and feedback loops"

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ Iterative agent reasoning (AgREE pattern)
- ✅ Open-ended graph expansion (hubs, bridges, centrality)
- ✅ Meta-agent analysis of agent collaboration
- ✅ Continuous learning from graph evolution

### 2. Real-Time Entity Detection (Your Second Research)
**Key Insight**: "Emerging entities detected via NER, burst detection, and context clustering from streaming data"

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ Automated NER for new entity mentions
- ✅ Frequency tracking with burst detection (3+ mentions in time window)
- ✅ Context clustering for unusual term co-occurrences
- ✅ Fuzzy matching to filter variants

### 3. Provenance & Trust Signals (Your Third Research)
**Key Insight**: "Reliability depends on recording strong provenance metadata and trust signals"

**Implemented Features**:
- ✅ Source URI/Document tracking
- ✅ Extraction timestamp and extractor identity
- ✅ Supporting evidence (snippets, quotes)
- ✅ Complete change audit trail
- ✅ Source quality classification (peer-reviewed, preprint, blog, etc.)
- ✅ Verification status (pending/validated/rejected)
- ✅ Cross-source corroboration count
- ✅ Reputation score (0.0-1.0)
- ✅ Recency score
- ✅ Semantic consistency score

## System Capabilities

### 1. Emerging Entity Detection
```python
EmergingEntityDetector:
  - NER extraction (spaCy or transformer-based)
  - Frequency tracking per entity
  - Burst detection (3+ mentions in 1 hour = emerging)
  - Fuzzy matching to avoid duplicates
```

**Example**:
```
Paper 1: "quantum neural networks" → First mention (tracked)
Paper 3: "quantum neural networks" → Second mention (tracked)
Paper 5: "quantum neural networks" → BURST DETECTED! (3 mentions)
  → Creates EmergingEntity node with full provenance
```

### 2. Temporal Knowledge Graph
```cypher
Concept:EmergingEntity {
  name: "quantum neural networks",
  first_seen: "2025-10-01T10:30:00",
  last_updated: "2025-10-01T14:20:00",
  mention_count: 3,
  emergence_score: 0.85,
  status: "emerging"
}

// Track evolution
(Entity)-[:EVOLVED_INTO {
  transition_date: "2025-10-05",
  transition_type: "refinement"
}]->(NewEntity)
```

**Enables**:
- Time-based queries: "What concepts emerged in Q1 2025?"
- Lineage tracking: "neural arch search" → "differentiable NAS" → "zero-cost NAS"
- Historical snapshots: Query graph state at any point in time

### 3. Emergent Pattern Recognition
```python
EmergentPatternDetector:
  - Hub formation (concepts with >20 relationships)
  - Bridge nodes (connecting disconnected clusters)
  - Cross-domain emergence (biology + ML connections)
  - Structural evolution metrics (modularity, clustering)
```

**Example**:
```
Papers 1-10: "neural arch search" gets 5 relationships → Normal
Papers 11-20: "neural arch search" gets 15 more → Total 20 → HUB DETECTED!
Papers 21-30: Connects to "meta-learning" cluster → BRIDGE NODE!
```

### 4. Provenance Tracking (NEW)
```python
ProvenanceTracker:
  - create_emerging_entity_with_provenance()
  - add_corroboration()  # When 2nd+ paper mentions entity
  - verify_entity()  # Human or ML validation
  - calculate_semantic_consistency()  # Fits graph topology?
```

**Full Neo4j Provenance Schema**:
```cypher
// Emerging entity with ALL trust signals
(e:Concept:EmergingEntity {
  // PROVENANCE
  source_uri: "file:///qnn_2025.pdf",
  extraction_timestamp: "2025-10-01T10:30:00",
  extractor_identity: "spaCy_NER_v3.7_Agent_Concept_Extractor",
  supporting_evidence: "...quantum neural networks leverage...",

  // TRUST SIGNALS
  verification_status: "pending_review",
  corroboration_count: 3,
  source_quality: "peer_reviewed",
  reputation_score: 0.85,
  recency_score: 0.95,
  semantic_consistency_score: 0.78
})

// Provenance links
(e)-[:EXTRACTED_BY]->(Agent)
(e)-[:EXTRACTED_FROM]->(Document)
(e)-[:CORROBORATED_BY]->(Document2)
(e)-[:VERIFIED_BY]->(VerificationEvent)
(e)-[:HAS_CHANGE_HISTORY]->(ChangeEvent)
```

**Trust Progression**:
```
Paper 1: Entity created (corroboration: 1, reputation: 0.7)
Paper 3: Corroboration added (corroboration: 2, reputation: 0.75)
Paper 5: Corroboration added (corroboration: 3, reputation: 0.80)
Human review: Verified (status: "validated", reputation: 0.85)
  → Promoted from EmergingEntity to EstablishedEntity
```

### 5. Meta-Agent Analysis
```python
MetaAnalysisAgent (runs daily):
  - analyze_graph_evolution()
  - detect_emerging_entities()
  - detect_hub_formation()
  - detect_bridge_nodes()
  - detect_cross_domain_emergence()
  - analyze_agent_collaboration()
  - calculate_structural_metrics()
  - update_cognition_from_analysis()
```

**Meta-Agent Learnings**:
```
Day 1: Detects Agent A + Agent B collaborate well (avg quality: 0.87)
  → Records in Cognition Base
  → Future tasks: Prioritize this pair for complex documents

Day 3: Detects "quantum neural networks" emerging (mention count: 5)
  → Boosts priority for curiosity agents
  → Recommends related papers to ingest

Day 7: Detects biology + ML cross-domain pattern
  → Alerts user: "Novel cross-domain connection discovered"
  → Suggests research direction
```

### 6. Co-occurrence Analysis
```python
CooccurrenceAnalyzer:
  - Track which concepts appear together
  - Detect unusual co-occurrences (semantic surprise >0.7)
  - Identify multi-word entities
  - Flag semantic drift
```

**Example**:
```
"quantum" + "neural networks" appear together 8 times
Semantic distance: 0.85 (high surprise - unusual combination)
  → Flag as emerging multi-word entity
  → Validate with human or meta-agent
```

## Integration with Existing Specs

### With Spec 028 (ThoughtSeeds)
```python
# When ThoughtSeed created, check if concept is emerging
if concept in emerging_entities:
    thoughtseed.priority *= 1.5  # Boost priority
    thoughtseed.emergence_score = emerging_entities[concept].emergence_score
```

### With Spec 029 (Curiosity Agents)
```python
# When curiosity triggered, check if entity is emerging
if trigger.concept in emerging_entities:
    trigger.priority *= 1.5
    trigger.knowledge_gap_type = "emerging_entity"
    # Spawn curiosity agent with higher priority
```

### With Spec 031 (Conflict Resolution)
```python
# When conflict detected, use provenance to resolve
if conflict.type == "DUPLICATE_NODE_CREATION":
    # Compare reputation scores
    keep_node = max(nodes, key=lambda n: n.reputation_score)
    # Merge provenance from duplicate
    merge_provenance(keep_node, duplicate_node)
```

**Status**: ✅ Spec complete with full provenance and trust signals
**Priority**: HIGH - Foundation for trustworthy knowledge graph
**Estimated Time**: 26-32 hours
**Dependencies**: Neo4j, spaCy/transformers (NER), Specs 028/029/031
