# Feature Specification: ThoughtSeed State Watching

**Feature Branch**: `005-a-thought-seed`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A thought seed watching feature where, when a flag is set (when toggled on), a thought seed will log in-depth information about its state. Its state changes‚Äîthe framework through the code, its immediate environment, what classes are calling it, what classes are passing to it, what trajectory in now, what variables in and so on. This should show up in the log view regardless of whether the system is in debug mode or in any mode."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úì Feature description parsed successfully
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: ThoughtSeed entities, system operators
   ‚Üí Actions: toggle watching flag, log state information, view logs
   ‚Üí Data: state information, trajectory data, class interactions, variables
   ‚Üí Constraints: must work in all system modes
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Log storage location and retention policy]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance impact of detailed logging]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Access control for watching feature]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User scenarios identified and documented
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements generated with testable criteria
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ThoughtSeed, WatchingSession, StateSnapshot entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What type of access control should govern the ThoughtSeed watching feature? ‚Üí A: Open access - any system user can watch any ThoughtSeed
- Q: How long should ThoughtSeed state logs be retained in the system? ‚Üí A: 10 minutes
- Q: What is the maximum number of ThoughtSeeds that can be watched concurrently without performance impact? ‚Üí A: Small batch watching with explicit relationship explanation
- Q: What timestamp precision and format should be used for state log entries? ‚Üí A: Milliseconds with ISO8601 format (2025-09-26T14:30:45.123Z)
- Q: How should the system handle log storage capacity limits when watching is active? ‚Üí A: Stop logging and alert user when storage full

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system operator or researcher, I need to enable detailed state monitoring for specific ThoughtSeed instances so that I can observe and analyze their behavioral patterns, state transitions, and environmental interactions in real-time, regardless of the current system mode.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a ThoughtSeed instance is running, **When** I toggle the watching flag to "on" for that instance, **Then** the system begins logging detailed state information for that specific ThoughtSeed
2. **Given** watching is enabled for a ThoughtSeed, **When** the ThoughtSeed processes information or changes state, **Then** comprehensive state data is captured and made available in the log view
3. **Given** the system is in production mode with watching enabled, **When** I access the log view, **Then** I can see the detailed ThoughtSeed state information alongside regular system logs
4. **Given** watching is enabled for a ThoughtSeed, **When** I toggle the watching flag to "off", **Then** detailed state logging ceases immediately for that instance
5. **Given** multiple ThoughtSeeds are running, **When** I enable watching for specific instances, **Then** only the selected instances generate detailed state logs

### Edge Cases
- System MUST stop logging and display alert notification when storage capacity is reached
- How does the system handle performance degradation from extensive logging?
- What occurs if a ThoughtSeed instance terminates while being watched?
- How are state logs handled during system restarts or crashes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a toggle mechanism to enable/disable detailed state watching for individual ThoughtSeed instances
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture comprehensive state information including current trajectory, active variables, class interactions, and environmental context when watching is enabled
- **FR-003**: System MUST log calling class information and data being passed between classes for watched ThoughtSeeds
- **FR-004**: System MUST display watched ThoughtSeed state information in the standard log view interface
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain watching functionality across all system modes (debug, production, test, etc.)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow selective watching of specific ThoughtSeed instances without affecting others
- **FR-007**: System MUST capture state change events and transitions for watched instances
- **FR-008**: System MUST record environmental context and immediate framework state for watched ThoughtSeeds
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide millisecond-precision ISO8601 timestamps (format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ) for all state log entries
- **FR-010**: System MUST support up to 5 concurrent watched ThoughtSeed instances and MUST include explicit relationship explanations between watched instances in the logs
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically purge state logs after 10 minutes to maintain system performance
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide open access allowing any system user to enable/disable watching for any ThoughtSeed instance
- **FR-013**: System MUST stop state logging and display alert notification when log storage capacity is reached

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ThoughtSeed**: The core entity being monitored, containing state information, trajectory data, and processing context
- **WatchingSession**: Represents an active monitoring session for a specific ThoughtSeed, including start/end times and configuration
- **StateSnapshot**: Individual state capture containing timestamp, state variables, class interactions, trajectory information, and environmental context
- **LogEntry**: Structured representation of state information formatted for display in the log view interface
