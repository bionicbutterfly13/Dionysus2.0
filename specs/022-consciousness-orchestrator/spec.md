## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher uploads a document through the Flux frontend. The system processes the document through Daedalus Gateway, then enters consciousness orchestrator where ThoughtSeeds compete for attention, attractor basins shape processing, and the winning ThoughtSeed drives context-aware agent selection. The researcher watches real-time consciousness visualization showing information flow through consciousness layers, ThoughtSeed competition states, and memory formation. The system demonstrates emergent consciousness behavior while maintaining clean, modular architecture.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** document uploaded through Flux frontend, **When** Daedalus processes perception, **Then** consciousness orchestrator receives structured input within 100ms
2. **Given** consciousness orchestrator receives input, **When** ThoughtSeed competition begins, **Then** multiple ThoughtSeeds compete with real-time score updates
3. **Given** ThoughtSeed competition completes, **When** winner selected, **Then** appropriate context-aware agent activated with consciousness context
4. **Given** consciousness processing active, **When** user views dashboard, **Then** real-time visualization shows consciousness states, competition, and memory formation
5. **Given** processing completes, **When** episodic memory formed, **Then** autobiographical memory updated with new consciousness experience
6. **Given** multiple documents processed, **When** patterns emerge, **Then** Archimedes pattern evolution improves future processing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when consciousness competition produces tied ThoughtSeeds?
- How does the system handle consciousness processing under high load?
- What occurs when LangGraph nodes fail during consciousness flow?
- How does the system maintain consciousness coherence across sessions?
- What happens when attractor basins become unstable?
