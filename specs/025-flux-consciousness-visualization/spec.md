# Spec 025: Flux Frontend Consciousness Visualization

## Summary
Create real-time consciousness flow visualization in Flux frontend showing ThoughtSeed competition, attractor dynamics, and memory formation with interactive controls.

## User Story
As a consciousness researcher, I want to see real-time visualization of consciousness processing in the Flux interface so that I can understand how ThoughtSeeds compete, attractors influence processing, and memories form.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-025-001: Real-Time Consciousness Flow
- Live visualization of consciousness processing stages
- ThoughtSeed competition visualization with scores and status
- Attractor basin dynamics with activation levels
- Memory formation tracking (episodic â†’ autobiographical)

### FR-025-002: Interactive Consciousness Controls
- Manual ThoughtSeed injection and manipulation
- Attractor basin parameter adjustment
- Consciousness state inspection and debugging
- Processing speed controls (pause, slow-motion, replay)

### FR-025-003: Three.js Consciousness Rendering
- 3D consciousness space with flowing information
- Particle systems for ThoughtSeed movement
- Force-directed attractor visualization
- WebGL-accelerated real-time rendering

### FR-025-004: WebSocket Real-Time Updates
- WebSocket connection to consciousness engine
- Sub-100ms latency for consciousness state updates
- Efficient differential state updates
- Connection resilience and auto-reconnection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time consciousness visualization in Flux frontend
- [ ] Interactive controls for consciousness manipulation
- [ ] 3D Three.js rendering with smooth animations
- [ ] WebSocket integration with <100ms latency
- [ ] Consciousness debugging and inspection tools

## Dependencies
- Spec-022: Consciousness orchestrator (data source)
- Flux frontend React/Three.js infrastructure
- WebSocket API for real-time communication
- ConsciousnessFlowVisualizer implementation
