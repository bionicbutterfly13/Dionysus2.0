## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: How should the system handle authentication and authorization for different user types? → A: Single-user software with passcode authentication via GoHighLevel API membership architecture
- Q: What should happen when the system reaches capacity limits? → A: Auto-purge least-recently-accessed patterns/agents with user alert and rescue option
- Q: How should the system store and persist user data between sessions? → A: Local storage primary, optional mobile sync, encrypted backup to iCloud/Google Drive/Dropbox
- Q: When encountering completely novel problems with no similar patterns, what should Archimedes do? → A: Activate curiosity-driven information gathering, use general templates with strict no-hallucination policy and confidence levels
- Q: What is the primary purpose of the system's knowledge capabilities? → A: Personal knowledge base management - autobiographical construct for organizing and engaging with user's collected ideas over time

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has collected ideas, insights, and knowledge over time and wants to engage with their personal knowledge base in a more organized and supported way. The Archimedes-Daedalus system helps them explore connections between their ideas, evolve their thinking patterns, and create specialized agents to work with different aspects of their knowledge. When they encounter new problems or questions, the system draws from their autobiographical construct of ideas to provide personalized, contextual assistance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a novel problem is submitted, **When** Archimedes analyzes it, **Then** the system recognizes novelty within 100ms and triggers pattern evolution
2. **Given** pattern evolution is triggered, **When** new patterns are generated, **Then** the system creates effective solution approaches with >80% success rate
3. **Given** a problem requires specialized expertise, **When** Daedalus evaluates domain requirements, **Then** appropriate specialized agents are created or selected with >90% accuracy
4. **Given** multiple agents are selected, **When** committee formation is triggered, **Then** an effective reasoning committee is formed within 2 seconds
5. **Given** a committee is working on a problem, **When** cognitive tools are applied, **Then** solution quality improves by >20% compared to individual agents
6. **Given** a solution is found, **When** feedback is provided, **Then** the system evolves patterns and agent capabilities for future problems

### Edge Cases
- What happens when pattern evolution fails to generate viable solutions?
- How does the system handle agent training that doesn't converge?
- What occurs when committee members provide conflicting recommendations?
- How does the system maintain performance under peak load (1000+ concurrent problems)?
- What happens when specialized agents become unavailable during problem solving?
