# Research: Archimedes-Daedalus Synergistic System

## Technology Stack Research

### Decision: Python 3.11 with NumPy <2.0
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement for ASI-Arch compatibility. Python 3.11 provides optimal performance while maintaining NumPy 1.26.4 compatibility required by the constitution.
**Alternatives considered**: Python 3.12 rejected due to potential NumPy compatibility issues.

### Decision: Extend ASI-Arch Structure
**Rationale**: System must preserve all existing ASI-Arch functionality (FR-007) while adding new capabilities. Extension pattern maintains compatibility.
**Alternatives considered**: Standalone system rejected - would break integration requirements.

### Decision: Local Storage Primary with Optional Cloud Backup
**Rationale**: User clarification specified local storage for core data with optional encrypted backup to iCloud/Google Drive/Dropbox.
**Alternatives considered**: Full cloud storage rejected - user wants local control.

### Decision: GoHighLevel API for Authentication
**Rationale**: User clarification specified single-user software with passcode authentication managed through GoHighLevel API for membership validation.
**Alternatives considered**: Traditional auth systems rejected - specific integration requirement.

## Architecture Research

### Decision: Redis + Neo4j + Context Engineering Integration
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement for Redis (real-time) and Neo4j (knowledge graphs). Context Engineering provides decay mechanism for basin management.
**Alternatives considered**: Alternative databases rejected due to constitutional compliance.

### Decision: Agent Factory Pattern for Dynamic Agent Creation
**Rationale**: User clarification that Daedalus creates agents dynamically in real-time based on available tools and situation demands.
**Alternatives considered**: Pre-trained agent pools rejected - doesn't match real-time creation requirement.

### Decision: Curiosity-Driven Information Gathering for Novel Problems
**Rationale**: User clarification specified activating curiosity element for knowledge gaps, with strict no-hallucination policy.
**Alternatives considered**: Hallucination-based fallbacks rejected - violates user requirements.

## Integration Research

### Decision: ThoughtSeed Framework Integration
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement for consciousness detection and active inference. System must maintain consciousness state consistency.
**Alternatives considered**: Custom consciousness detection rejected - violates constitutional requirements.

### Decision: IBM Cognitive Tools Integration
**Rationale**: Specification requires cognitive tools (understand_question, recall_related, examine_answer, backtracking) for enhanced reasoning.
**Alternatives considered**: Custom reasoning tools considered but IBM-validated tools provide proven cognitive enhancement.

## Personal Knowledge Management Research

### Decision: Autobiographical Construct Pattern
**Rationale**: User clarification that primary purpose is organizing user's collected ideas over time, not internet search.
**Alternatives considered**: Search-engine pattern rejected - not the main use case.

### Decision: Pattern Evolution with Basin Activation Frequency
**Rationale**: User clarification that patterns are reactivated based on frequency of basin/archetype activation, not simple age.
**Alternatives considered**: Simple LRU cache rejected - doesn't match activation-based retention.

## Performance Research

### Decision: 100ms Pattern Matching Target
**Rationale**: Specification requirement for rapid pattern recognition to support real-time problem analysis.
**Alternatives considered**: Longer latencies rejected - breaks real-time user experience.

### Decision: Committee Formation in 2 Seconds
**Rationale**: Specification requirement for rapid committee assembly while maintaining quality.
**Alternatives considered**: Instant formation rejected - quality requires some computation time.
