# Quickstart: CLAUSE Phase 1 - Subgraph Architect

**Feature**: CLAUSE Subgraph Architect with Basin Strengthening
**Time to Complete**: ~15 minutes
**Prerequisites**: Python 3.11+, Neo4j 5.x, Redis 7.x

## Overview

This quickstart demonstrates:
1. Building a budget-aware subgraph using CLAUSE 5-signal edge scoring
2. Strengthening attractor basins as concepts reappear (+0.2 per appearance)
3. Tracking co-occurring concepts across documents
4. Querying basin evolution over time

## Step 1: Environment Setup (5 min)

### 1.1 Start Required Services
```bash
# Start Neo4j (if not running)
docker-compose up -d neo4j

# Start Redis (if not running)
docker-compose up -d redis

# Verify services
docker ps | grep -E "neo4j|redis"
```

### 1.2 Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
# Use existing backend environment
cd backend
source flux-backend-env/bin/activate

# Verify NumPy 2.0+ (Constitution Article I)
python -c "import numpy; assert numpy.__version__.startswith('2.'), 'NumPy 1.x detected'"
```

### 1.3 Install Phase 1 Dependencies
```bash
# Install CLAUSE-specific packages
pip install networkx>=3.1 sentence-transformers>=2.2.0

# Verify installation
python -c "import networkx as nx; import sentence_transformers; print('âœ… Dependencies installed')"
```

## Step 2: Initialize CLAUSE Services (5 min)

### 2.1 Create Sample Knowledge Graph
```python
# scripts/setup_clause_demo.py
import asyncio
from backend.src.config.neo4j_config import Neo4jConfig
from backend.src.services.clause.architect import CLAUSESubgraphArchitect
from backend.src.services.basin_tracker import BasinTracker

async def setup_demo_graph():
    """Creates sample knowledge graph for CLAUSE demo."""

    # Initialize Neo4j
    neo4j_config = Neo4jConfig()
    await neo4j_config.initialize()

    # Sample concepts (neural architecture search domain)
    concepts = [
        ("neural_architecture", "RELATED_TO", "search_algorithms"),
        ("neural_architecture", "USES", "reinforcement_learning"),
        ("search_algorithms", "INCLUDES", "gradient_descent"),
        ("reinforcement_learning", "APPLIES_TO", "policy_optimization"),
        ("neural_architecture", "ENABLES", "automl"),
        ("automl", "IMPROVES", "model_performance"),
        ("differentiable_nas", "IS_TYPE_OF", "neural_architecture"),
        ("zero_cost_nas", "IS_TYPE_OF", "neural_architecture"),
        ("nas_bench", "EVALUATES", "neural_architecture"),
        ("supernet", "TRAINS", "neural_architecture"),
    ]

    # Insert triplets
    for subj, rel, obj in concepts:
        await neo4j_config.driver.execute_query("""
            MERGE (s:Concept {concept_id: $subj, name: $subj})
            MERGE (o:Concept {concept_id: $obj, name: $obj})
            MERGE (s)-[r:RELATES_TO {type: $rel}]->(o)
        """, subj=subj, rel=rel, obj=obj)

    print("âœ… Demo graph created with 10 concept triplets")

# Run setup
asyncio.run(setup_demo_graph())
```

### 2.2 Initialize Basin Tracker
```python
# scripts/init_basin_tracker.py
from backend.src.services.basin_tracker import BasinTracker

async def init_tracker():
    tracker = BasinTracker()

    # Pre-populate basins from graph
    concepts = [
        "neural_architecture",
        "search_algorithms",
        "reinforcement_learning",
        "gradient_descent",
        "automl"
    ]

    for concept in concepts:
        basin = await tracker.get_or_create_basin(concept)
        print(f"âœ… Basin created: {basin.basin_name} (strength={basin.strength})")

asyncio.run(init_tracker())
```

## Step 3: Build Your First Subgraph (2 min)

### 3.1 Basic Subgraph Construction
```python
from backend.src.services.clause.architect import CLAUSESubgraphArchitect

async def build_subgraph_example():
    # Initialize architect
    architect = CLAUSESubgraphArchitect(
        neo4j_driver=get_neo4j_driver(),
        basin_tracker=BasinTracker()
    )

    # Build subgraph with budget
    request = SubgraphRequest(
        query="What is neural architecture search?",
        edge_budget=50,
        lambda_edge=0.01,
        hop_distance=2
    )

    response = await architect.build_subgraph(request)

    print(f"""
    âœ… Subgraph Built:
    - Edges selected: {response.budget_used}/{request.edge_budget}
    - Construction time: {response.construction_time_ms:.2f}ms
    - Stopped reason: {response.stopped_reason}
    - Basins strengthened: {len(response.basins_strengthened)}
    """)

    # Inspect top edges
    for i, edge in enumerate(response.selected_edges[:5]):
        score = response.edge_scores[tuple(edge)]
        gain = response.shaped_gains[tuple(edge)]
        print(f"  {i+1}. {edge[0]} --[{edge[1]}]--> {edge[2]}")
        print(f"     Score: {score:.3f}, Shaped Gain: {gain:.3f}")

asyncio.run(build_subgraph_example())
```

**Expected Output**:
```
âœ… Subgraph Built:
- Edges selected: 48/50
- Construction time: 245.30ms
- Stopped reason: BUDGET_EXHAUSTED
- Basins strengthened: 8

  1. neural_architecture --[RELATED_TO]--> search_algorithms
     Score: 0.870, Shaped Gain: 0.860
  2. neural_architecture --[USES]--> reinforcement_learning
     Score: 0.820, Shaped Gain: 0.810
  ...
```

## Step 4: Basin Strengthening Workflow (3 min)

### 4.1 Simulate Document Processing
```python
from backend.src.services.basin_tracker import BasinTracker

async def document_processing_demo():
    tracker = BasinTracker()

    # Simulate 3 documents mentioning "neural_architecture"
    documents = [
        {
            "id": "doc1",
            "concepts": ["neural_architecture", "search_algorithms", "automl"]
        },
        {
            "id": "doc2",
            "concepts": ["neural_architecture", "reinforcement_learning"]
        },
        {
            "id": "doc3",
            "concepts": ["neural_architecture", "differentiable_nas", "supernet"]
        }
    ]

    for doc in documents:
        # Strengthen basins
        response = await tracker.strengthen_basins(
            concepts=doc["concepts"],
            document_id=doc["id"],
            increment=0.2
        )

        print(f"\nðŸ“„ Document {doc['id']} processed:")
        for basin in response.updated_basins:
            print(f"  â€¢ {basin.basin_name}: strength {basin.strength:.1f} (activations: {basin.activation_count})")

    # Final basin state
    neural_arch_basin = await tracker.get_basin("neural_architecture")
    print(f"""
    \nâœ… Final 'neural_architecture' basin state:
    - Strength: {neural_arch_basin.strength:.1f} (appeared in 3 docs: 1.0 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 1.6)
    - Activation count: {neural_arch_basin.activation_count}
    - Co-occurring concepts: {list(neural_arch_basin.co_occurring_concepts.keys())}
    """)

asyncio.run(document_processing_demo())
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ðŸ“„ Document doc1 processed:
  â€¢ neural_architecture: strength 1.2 (activations: 1)
  â€¢ search_algorithms: strength 1.2 (activations: 1)
  â€¢ automl: strength 1.0 (activations: 0)

ðŸ“„ Document doc2 processed:
  â€¢ neural_architecture: strength 1.4 (activations: 2)
  â€¢ reinforcement_learning: strength 1.2 (activations: 1)

ðŸ“„ Document doc3 processed:
  â€¢ neural_architecture: strength 1.6 (activations: 3)
  â€¢ differentiable_nas: strength 1.0 (activations: 0)
  â€¢ supernet: strength 1.0 (activations: 0)

âœ… Final 'neural_architecture' basin state:
- Strength: 1.6 (appeared in 3 docs: 1.0 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 1.6)
- Activation count: 3
- Co-occurring concepts: ['search_algorithms', 'automl', 'reinforcement_learning', 'differentiable_nas', 'supernet']
```

### 4.2 Observe Basin Influence on Edge Scoring
```python
async def basin_influence_demo():
    architect = CLAUSESubgraphArchitect()

    # Query 1: Before basin strengthening
    response1 = await architect.build_subgraph(
        SubgraphRequest(query="neural architecture search", edge_budget=10)
    )

    # Strengthen "neural_architecture" basin (+0.4 from 2 more appearances)
    tracker = BasinTracker()
    await tracker.strengthen_basins(["neural_architecture"] * 2, "doc_extra", 0.2)

    # Query 2: After basin strengthening
    response2 = await architect.build_subgraph(
        SubgraphRequest(query="neural architecture search", edge_budget=10)
    )

    print(f"""
    Basin Influence on Edge Selection:

    Before strengthening (strength=1.6):
      Selected edges: {response1.budget_used}
      Top edge score: {max(response1.edge_scores.values()):.3f}

    After strengthening (strength=2.0 - capped):
      Selected edges: {response2.budget_used}
      Top edge score: {max(response2.edge_scores.values()):.3f}

    ðŸ’¡ Higher basin strength â†’ Higher edge scores â†’ More edges selected with "neural_architecture"
    """)

asyncio.run(basin_influence_demo())
```

## Step 5: Query Basin Evolution (2 min)

### 5.1 Time-Based Basin Queries
```python
async def basin_evolution_query():
    tracker = BasinTracker()

    # Get basin with history
    basin = await tracker.get_basin("neural_architecture")

    print(f"""
    ðŸ“Š Basin Evolution Analysis: '{basin.basin_name}'

    Strength Timeline:
    """)

    for i, timestamp in enumerate(basin.activation_history):
        strength = 1.0 + (i * 0.2)
        print(f"  {timestamp}: strength = {strength:.1f}")

    print(f"""
    Co-occurrence Network:
    """)

    for concept, count in sorted(
        basin.co_occurring_concepts.items(),
        key=lambda x: -x[1]
    )[:5]:
        print(f"  â€¢ {concept}: {count} co-occurrences")

asyncio.run(basin_evolution_query())
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ðŸ“Š Basin Evolution Analysis: 'neural_architecture'

Strength Timeline:
  2025-10-01T10:00:00: strength = 1.0
  2025-10-01T15:30:00: strength = 1.2
  2025-10-01T18:45:00: strength = 1.4
  2025-10-01T21:15:00: strength = 1.6
  2025-10-01T23:00:00: strength = 1.8

Co-occurrence Network:
  â€¢ search_algorithms: 4 co-occurrences
  â€¢ reinforcement_learning: 3 co-occurrences
  â€¢ automl: 2 co-occurrences
  â€¢ differentiable_nas: 2 co-occurrences
  â€¢ supernet: 1 co-occurrence
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "NumPy 1.x detected" error
**Solution**: Reinstall NumPy 2.0+
```bash
pip install "numpy>=2.0" --upgrade --force-reinstall
python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
```

### Issue: Neo4j connection refused
**Solution**: Verify Neo4j is running and accessible
```bash
docker ps | grep neo4j
curl http://localhost:7474  # Should return HTML page
```

### Issue: Basin cache not updating
**Solution**: Clear Redis cache
```bash
redis-cli FLUSHDB
python scripts/init_basin_tracker.py  # Re-initialize
```

### Issue: Edge scoring too slow (>10ms)
**Solution**: Check NumPy vectorization is working
```python
import numpy as np
# Verify NumPy 2.0 vectorization
arr = np.random.rand(1000, 5)
weights = np.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.15])
%timeit arr @ weights  # Should be <1ms
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run Contract Tests**: `pytest backend/tests/contract/test_architect_contract.py -v`
2. **Try Different Budgets**: Experiment with `edge_budget` values (10, 50, 100)
3. **Visualize Subgraph**: Use NetworkX visualization to see selected edges
4. **Phase 2**: Integrate with conflict resolution (Spec 031)
5. **Phase 3**: Add Path Navigator and Context Curator agents
