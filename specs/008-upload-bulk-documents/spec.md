## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher wants to upload multiple documents in bulk and observe their complete journey through the entire system architecture, from initial processing through memory formation, database storage, and attractor basin formation, with detailed visibility into data transformations and hierarchical relationships through an interactive debug panel in the Flux interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has multiple documents to process, **When** they upload documents in bulk through Flux, **Then** the system processes each document through the complete pipeline and provides real-time visibility into each processing stage
2. **Given** documents are flowing through the system, **When** the user accesses the debug panel, **Then** they can see hierarchical data trees showing document transformations, memory type classifications, and database storage locations
3. **Given** the processing pipeline is active, **When** documents reach different system elements, **Then** the debug panel updates in real-time showing current processing status, data types, and relationship formations
4. **Given** documents have been processed and stored, **When** the user explores the hierarchical data trees, **Then** they can drill down into specific memory types, database entries, and attractor basin formations with full data type information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when bulk upload overwhelms system processing capacity or memory limits?
- How does the debug panel handle visualization when thousands of documents are processed simultaneously?
- What occurs when documents fail at different pipeline stages and how is this reflected in the debug interface?
- How are conflicting data types or malformed documents handled and displayed in the hierarchical trees?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support bulk document upload through the Flux web interface with drag-and-drop and file selection capabilities
- **FR-002**: System MUST track each document through every processing stage from upload to final storage and basin formation

- **FR-004**: System MUST display hierarchical data trees showing document transformations, memory classifications, and database relationships
- **FR-005**: System MUST classify and route documents to appropriate memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural) with visible decision paths
- **FR-006**: System MUST show database storage operations including target databases, data structures, and relationship formations
- **FR-007**: System MUST visualize attractor basin formation and document clustering patterns with explorable data structures
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to explore hierarchical data trees interactively with drill-down capabilities for detailed inspection
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide data type information for all processing stages including input formats, transformations, and output structures

- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain processing history and allow retrospective analysis of document journeys through the system
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to filter and search within hierarchical data trees based on document properties, processing stages, or data types [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: search criteria and filtering options not specified]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide export capabilities for processing pipeline data and debug information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export formats and data scope not detailed]
- **FR-015**: System MUST support real-time collaboration where multiple users can observe the same processing pipeline [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: collaboration features and permissions not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
