# Spec 023: Consciousness Context Engineering Integration

## Summary
Integrate context engineering standards with consciousness orchestrator to provide river metaphor dynamics and context-aware agent processing.

## User Story
As a consciousness system user, I want the consciousness orchestrator to follow context engineering framework patterns so that information flows like a river through attractor basins with proper semantic affordances.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-023-001: River Metaphor Integration
- Consciousness processing must follow river dynamics from context engineering
- Information flows through semantic channels with resistance/acceleration
- Attractor basins act as eddies and convergence points

### FR-023-002: Context-Aware Agent Framework  
- Agents receive full consciousness context (inner screen, thoughtseeds, attractors)
- Agent recommendations based on consciousness state
- Context richness scoring and validation

### FR-023-003: Semantic Affordance Processing
- Extract affordances from perceptual input
- Map affordances to consciousness processing stages
- Context-dependent affordance activation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] River dynamics integrated with LangGraph consciousness pipeline
- [ ] Context-aware agents receive rich consciousness state
- [ ] Semantic affordances processed through consciousness stages
- [ ] Context engineering principles validated in consciousness flow

## Dependencies
- Spec-022: Consciousness orchestrator implementation
- Legacy Dionysus context engineering framework
- ThoughtSeed competition system
