## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a** researcher using Dionysus for document analysis,
**I want** all my uploaded documents and their processing results to be permanently stored,
**So that** I can retrieve them later, browse my document history, and see the knowledge graph connections that were discovered.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I upload a new PDF document,
   **When** the system finishes processing it through the Daedalus workflow,
   **Then** all processing results (concepts, attractor basins, thoughtseeds, quality scores) are permanently stored and linked together.

2. **Given** I have uploaded 150 documents over the past month,
   **When** I view my document library,
   **Then** I see a paginated list showing 50 documents per page, with filename, upload date, quality score, and tag information.

3. **Given** I want to find all documents tagged with "neuroscience" that have high quality scores,
   **When** I apply filters for tag="neuroscience" and quality>0.8,
   **Then** the system returns only matching documents, sorted by quality score.

4. **Given** I select a specific document from my library,
   **When** I view its detail page,
   **Then** I see all extracted concepts organized by level (atomic, composite, context, etc.), all attractor basins it activated, all thoughtseeds it generated, and the complete quality analysis.

5. **Given** I upload the same document twice (same file content),
   **When** the system detects the duplicate via content hash,
   **Then** it recognizes this and either shows me the existing record or asks if I want to re-process it.

6. **Given** the system has processed 10,000+ documents,
   **When** I request the document list,
   **Then** the response returns within 500 milliseconds despite the large dataset.

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a document fails to process completely?**
  Partial results should still be stored with a status flag indicating incomplete processing.

- **What happens when tier storage limits are reached?**
  System should archive older documents to "cold" tier based on access patterns and age.

- **How does system handle concurrent uploads of the same document?**
  Use content hash locking to prevent duplicate processing of identical files.

- **What happens if a document is uploaded with no extractable concepts?**
  Store document metadata and mark quality metrics as low, but don't fail persistence.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Document Persistence**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST store document metadata including filename, upload timestamp, content hash, file size, MIME type, and user-provided tags
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist all processing results from Daedalus workflow including quality metrics, extracted concepts, attractor basins, and thoughtseeds
- **FR-003**: System MUST link all processing artifacts to their source document through explicit relationships
- **FR-004**: System MUST classify each document into a storage tier (warm, cool, or cold) based on access patterns and age
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect duplicate uploads using content hash comparison
- **FR-006**: System MUST complete full document persistence within 2 seconds for typical documents (1-5 MB PDF)

**Concept Storage**:
- **FR-007**: System MUST store extracted concepts across all 5 levels (atomic, relationship, composite, context, narrative)
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve concept salience scores and level classifications
- **FR-009**: System MUST link composite concepts to their atomic components
- **FR-010**: System MUST store derivation relationships between related concepts

**Consciousness Artifacts**:
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist attractor basin states including basin name, depth, stability, and associated concepts
- **FR-012**: System MUST store thoughtseed data including content, germination potential, and resonance scores
- **FR-013**: System MUST link basins to documents via "attracted to" relationships with activation strength
- **FR-014**: System MUST link thoughtseeds to documents via "germinated from" relationships
- **FR-015**: System MUST store basin influence modifications caused by each document (reinforcement, competition, synthesis, emergence)

**Document Retrieval**:
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide a way to list all stored documents with pagination
- **FR-017**: System MUST support filtering documents by tags, date range, and quality score thresholds
- **FR-018**: System MUST support sorting documents by upload date, quality score, or curiosity trigger count
- **FR-019**: System MUST return paginated document lists within 500 milliseconds for datasets up to 10,000 documents
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide detailed view of individual documents including all linked processing artifacts

**Data Integrity**:
- **FR-021**: System MUST use atomic transactions when persisting document data to prevent partial writes
- **FR-022**: System MUST retry transient database failures up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **FR-023**: System MUST maintain referential integrity between documents and their linked artifacts
- **FR-024**: System MUST validate that required fields (document_id, content_hash, filename) are present before persistence

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- **FR-025**: System MUST access the graph database ONLY through the constitutional Graph Channel interface (per Spec 040 requirements)
- **FR-026**: System MUST include audit trail information (caller service, caller function) on all database operations
- **FR-027**: System MUST NOT import or use direct database drivers that bypass the Graph Channel

**Tier Management**:
- **FR-028**: System MUST track which tier (warm, cool, cold) each document is stored in
- **FR-029**: System MUST allow tier transitions based on hybrid criteria combining both age and access patterns (documents age to cooler tiers over time, but frequently accessed documents remain in warmer tiers regardless of age)
- **FR-030**: System MUST archive cold-tier documents to separate cheaper storage (S3, filesystem) while retaining metadata and document reference in Neo4j, with understanding that cold document retrieval will be slower than warm/cool tier access

### Key Entities

- **Document**: Represents an uploaded file with its metadata (filename, upload time, content hash, size, type, tags), processing results (quality scores, processing duration), and tier classification (warm/cool/cold)

- **Concept**: Represents an extracted idea or concept from a document, classified by level (atomic, relationship, composite, context, narrative), with salience score indicating importance

- **Attractor Basin**: Represents a stable conceptual domain in the consciousness processing landscape, with depth (strength of attraction), stability, and a set of associated concepts

- **ThoughtSeed**: Represents a question or insight generated during document processing, with germination potential (likelihood of leading to new insights) and resonance score (connection to existing knowledge)

- **Processing Result**: Aggregates all artifacts from Daedalus workflow for a document, including quality analysis, research plan, curiosity triggers, and processing timeline

- **Tier Classification**: Tracks storage tier assignment (warm = frequently accessed recent documents, cool = older accessed documents, cold = archived rarely-accessed documents)

## Context Engineering Integration Opportunities

Based on the Context Engineering Foundation, this feature will integrate consciousness processing components:

1. **Attractor Basin Persistence**: Store basin states and modifications caused by each document
2. **Basin Evolution Tracking**: Persist basin strength changes over time as new documents alter the landscape
3. **Neural Field Resonance**: Store field resonance patterns between concepts for cross-domain insights
4. **Consciousness Processing Artifacts**: Thoughtseeds and basins are first-class entities in the knowledge graph

These integrations ensure document persistence captures not just static content, but the dynamic consciousness processing that occurred during analysis.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: What triggers a document to migrate from one storage tier to another? → A: Hybrid approach combining age AND access patterns (old but frequently accessed stays warm, rarely accessed ages to cold faster)
- Q: What happens to documents when they reach the "cold" storage tier? → A: Archive to separate storage (cold documents moved to cheaper storage like S3/filesystem, only metadata remains in Neo4j, retrieval slower)

## Next Steps

**Before Planning**:
1. Run `/clarify` to resolve the 2 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items
2. Validate performance targets are achievable with existing infrastructure
3. Confirm constitutional compliance approach with Graph Channel team

**After Clarifications**:
1. Run `/plan` to generate implementation design
2. Run `/tasks` to break down into actionable work items
3. Begin implementation with constitutional compliance tests first
