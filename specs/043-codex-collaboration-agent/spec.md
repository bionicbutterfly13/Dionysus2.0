# Spec 043: Codex Collaboration Agent Participation

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: Draft  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-07  
**Specification Type**: Operations & Coordination  
**Development Methodology**: Spec-Driven Development with GitHub Spec Kit  

---

## üéØ Objective
Onboard the Codex CLI agent (Agent-CX) as a fully coordinated participant in the Dionysus 2.0 workspace, ensuring every contribution follows the constitution, Spec-Kit workflow, and multi-agent coordination rules while accelerating the replacement of placeholder logic with production-ready implementations.

---

## üìã Functional Requirements

### FR-043-001: Feature Branch Discipline
- **Requirement**: Agent-CX MUST create and work from a feature branch for every change set and merge to `main` only after validation.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - `git status` shows a non-main branch during active work.
  - Branch names documented in coordination logs.
  - Pull requests include references to relevant specs/tests.

### FR-043-002: Coordination Document Updates
- **Requirement**: Agent-CX MUST update coordination artifacts (status board, coordination protocol, logs) whenever participating in or completing tasks.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Agent-CX presence recorded in `AGENT_STATUS_BOARD.md` and `AGENT_COORDINATION_PROTOCOL.md`.
  - Status timestamps reflect latest interaction.
  - Open issues highlight Agent-CX responsibilities and blockers.

### FR-043-003: Placeholder & Spec Alignment Plan
- **Requirement**: Agent-CX MUST maintain a living plan for converting placeholder logic (e.g., response synthesis, document processing adapters) into real implementations.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Placeholder backlog documented with owning specs/tests.
  - Follow-up feature branches or tickets identified.
  - Plan stored in repo (status board, spec addendum, or backlog markdown).

### FR-043-004: Spec-First Execution
- **Requirement**: Agent-CX MUST author or update specs before implementation work begins.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - New features reference spec IDs in commits / branches.
  - Spec changes merged prior to or alongside code.

### FR-043-005: Test-Driven Workflow Support
- **Requirement**: Agent-CX MUST ensure each implementation plan includes failing tests before code updates, per `TDD_RULES.md`.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Test files identified in plan.
  - Placeholder assertions replaced with behavior-driven tests.
  - Test logs captured in final summaries.

## üîß Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-043-001**: Constitution Compliance ‚Äì verify NumPy, environment, and coordination rules before each task (documented in worklog).
- **NFR-043-002**: Transparency ‚Äì summarize branch, spec references, and test status in final hand-offs.
- **NFR-043-003**: Traceability ‚Äì link Agent-CX actions to specs, commits, and coordination updates.

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan

| Phase | Focus | Key Outputs |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Onboarding & Documentation | Update coordination docs, publish Spec 043, register feature branch |
| Phase 2 | Placeholder Backlog Definition | Catalogue flagged placeholder sites, map to specs/tests |
| Phase 3 | Execution Cadence | For each placeholder cluster: plan ‚Üí failing tests ‚Üí implementation branch ‚Üí merge |
| Phase 4 | Continuous Coordination | 15-minute status cadence, conflict avoidance, log updates |

---

## üì¶ Deliverables
- Updated coordination artifacts reflecting Agent-CX role.
- Spec 043 (this document) stored under `specs/043-codex-collaboration-agent/`.
- Placeholder remediation backlog tied to specs/tests.
- Feature branch records for each execution cycle.

---

## üìä Success Metrics
- 100% of Agent-CX changes originate from feature branches.
- Coordination documents updated within 15 minutes of activity.
- Placeholder backlog entries mapped to specs/tests with owners.
- Zero undocumented modifications attributed to Agent-CX.

---

## üîó Dependencies
- `AGENT_CONSTITUTION.md`
- `SPEC_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md`
- `TDD_RULES.md`
- Coordination documents (`AGENT_STATUS_BOARD.md`, `AGENT_COORDINATION_PROTOCOL.md`)
- Placeholder source specs (022, 006, 029, 035, etc.)

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status Snapshot
- Feature branch `feature/add-codex-agent` created.
- Coordination docs updated with Agent-CX role and tasks.
- Placeholder remediation plan queued for next execution phase.
- Awaiting scheduling of first implementation branch under this spec.
