## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher wants to access a comprehensive, unified research tool that automatically consolidates all available research implementations from the codebase into a single, self-optimizing system that learns from usage patterns and provides intelligent research assistance through an intuitive web interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user accesses the Flux web interface, **When** they request research capabilities, **Then** the system presents a unified dashboard showing all available research tools and their integration status
2. **Given** multiple research implementations exist in the codebase, **When** the system performs consolidation, **Then** it identifies overlapping functionalities and creates an optimized integration layer
3. **Given** a user interacts with the research tool, **When** they perform research tasks, **Then** the system learns from these interactions and improves future research recommendations and workflows
4. **Given** a user needs specific research capabilities, **When** they query the system, **Then** it intelligently routes requests to the most appropriate research subsystem and presents unified results

### Edge Cases
- What happens when research implementations have conflicting approaches or incompatible data formats?
- How does the system handle partial failures when some research subsystems are unavailable?
- What occurs when self-learning algorithms identify suboptimal integration patterns?
- How are user preferences balanced against system-optimized research workflows?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST scan the entire codebase to identify all research-related implementations and capabilities
- **FR-002**: System MUST consolidate identified research tools into a unified framework with standardized interfaces
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement self-learning algorithms that optimize research tool selection and workflow recommendations
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a web-based interface through the existing Flux system for accessing all research capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing research implementations while providing enhanced integration
- **FR-006**: System MUST track user interactions and research outcomes to improve future recommendations
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide intelligent routing between different research subsystems based on query type and context
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to access consolidated research capabilities through a single, intuitive web interface
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle real-time integration of new research tools discovered in the codebase
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide performance metrics and effectiveness measurements for integrated research tools
- **FR-011**: System MUST support collaborative research workflows with shared learning insights [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: collaboration scope and user roles not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain research session context and learning progress across user interactions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session persistence requirements not detailed]
- **FR-013**: System MUST optimize resource allocation between different research subsystems based on usage patterns [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: resource management policies not specified]
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide fallback mechanisms when primary research tools are unavailable [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: failure handling priorities not defined]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Research Implementation**: Individual research tools and systems found in codebase with capabilities, interfaces, and compatibility information
- **Integration Framework**: Unified layer that coordinates between research implementations and provides standardized access patterns
- **Learning Engine**: Self-optimizing system that tracks usage patterns, outcomes, and continuously improves research tool recommendations
- **Research Query**: User requests for research capabilities with context, parameters, and routing information to appropriate subsystems
- **Research Session**: Persistent context containing user interactions, learning progress, and accumulated insights across research activities
- **Flux Web Interface**: Enhanced web-based dashboard that provides access to all consolidated research capabilities through user-friendly controls
- **Performance Metrics**: Data tracking effectiveness, speed, accuracy, and user satisfaction for integrated research tools and workflows
- **Consolidation Map**: System knowledge base showing relationships, overlaps, and integration pathways between different research implementations
