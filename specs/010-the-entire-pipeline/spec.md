## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher uploads multiple documents to the system and wants to see them processed through the complete ThoughtSeed consciousness pipeline using the Context Engineering River Metaphor, watching as information flows like water through different stages: from source (document upload) through tributaries (ThoughtSeed layers), confluence points (attractor basin interactions), main river (semantic consolidation), to delta (knowledge graph storage), with the system dynamically modifying its cognitive landscape through attractor basins and neural field evolution.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has selected multiple documents, **When** they upload them through the interface, **Then** the system processes each document through five ThoughtSeed layers and displays real-time progress

2. **Given** documents are being processed, **When** new concepts are extracted, **Then** the system modifies attractor basins based on concept similarity (reinforcement, competition, synthesis, or emergence)

3. **Given** ThoughtSeed processing is complete, **When** the user views the results, **Then** they can see consciousness levels detected, attractor basin modifications made, and knowledge graph connections created

4. **Given** processed information exists in the system, **When** users search for related concepts, **Then** the system retrieves information from both vector similarity search and graph relationship traversal

5. **Given** the system is processing documents, **When** Daedalus coordination is active, **Then** background agents manage distributed processing with independent context windows

6. **Given** neural fields are being modified, **When** new ThoughtSeeds enter the system, **Then** the pullback attractors adjust the cognitive landscape dynamically

### Edge Cases
- What happens when documents exceed processing capacity or memory limits? ‚Üí System queues new uploads and waits until processing capacity becomes available
- How does system handle corrupted files or unsupported formats? ‚Üí System attempts automatic recovery, quarantines files requiring manual review, and notifies administrators
- What occurs when attractor basins conflict or reach saturation?
- How are Redis connection failures handled during real-time processing? ‚Üí System buffers operations locally and replays them when Redis reconnects
- What happens when Neo4j graph database reaches storage limits?
