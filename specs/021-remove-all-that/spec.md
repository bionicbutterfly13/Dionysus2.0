# Feature Specification: Clean Up Daedalus Class for Perceptual Information Gateway

**Feature Branch**: `021-remove-all-that`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Remove all that crap from the Daedalus class.It has one function: that function is to receive information from the outside. Perceptual information is the gateway. The data is received, the information. Right now, it's supposed to receive the information that's getting uploaded. When something gets uploaded, Daedalus gets it, and Daedalus has the ability to use the LangGraph architecture to create agents that can work within that graph structure. Whole piece right now, we're going to step through that. So right now, all I want from this run is to get all that crap out of DataList. I don't care where you put it. Most of that I don't know what that crap is, give me a simple, clean DataList class with nothing in it but that one functionality. Any other stuff that breaks, let me know. I'll just rip it out because it's not helpful."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: simplify Daedalus class to single function
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Daedalus class, LangGraph agents
   ‚Üí Actions: receive perceptual information, process uploads
   ‚Üí Data: uploaded information, perceptual data
   ‚Üí Constraints: single functionality focus, remove all non-essential code
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes "all that crap" - specific methods/features to remove]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: upload triggers Daedalus information reception
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Core: receive perceptual information from uploads
   ‚Üí Secondary: interface with LangGraph architecture
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Daedalus class, Perceptual Information, Upload data
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties about specific removal scope"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What should happen to removed functionality from the Daedalus class? ‚Üí A: Archive separately - move to backup/deprecated folder for reference
- Q: Which upload types should Daedalus handle as perceptual information? ‚Üí A: All file types - accept any uploaded file format
- Q: Should the cleanup follow Test-Driven Development approach? ‚Üí A: Yes - write tests first, then refactor Daedalus class

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When data is uploaded to the system, the Daedalus class should receive that perceptual information as the primary gateway, without any unnecessary complexity or additional functionality that doesn't serve this core purpose.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a file is uploaded to the system, **When** the upload process completes, **Then** Daedalus receives the perceptual information from that upload
2. **Given** Daedalus receives perceptual information, **When** processing begins, **Then** it can interface with LangGraph architecture to create agents
3. **Given** the Daedalus class exists, **When** examined, **Then** it contains only the essential functionality for receiving perceptual information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploads contain invalid or corrupted data?
- How does the system handle multiple simultaneous uploads?
- What occurs if LangGraph architecture is unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Tests MUST be written before any Daedalus class refactoring begins
- **FR-002**: Daedalus class MUST receive perceptual information from uploaded data
- **FR-003**: Daedalus class MUST serve as the primary gateway for external information
- **FR-004**: Daedalus class MUST interface with LangGraph architecture for agent creation
- **FR-005**: System MUST remove all non-essential functionality from Daedalus class
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain only the core perceptual information reception capability
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve upload-triggered information flow to Daedalus for all file types and formats
- **FR-008**: Removed functionality MUST be archived to backup/deprecated folder without breaking system operation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Daedalus Class**: Core gateway for receiving perceptual information from external sources
- **Perceptual Information**: Data received from uploads that represents external sensory input
- **Upload Data**: Files or information submitted to the system that trigger Daedalus processing
- **LangGraph Agents**: Processing entities created within the graph structure for handling received information
