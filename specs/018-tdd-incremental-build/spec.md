## Overview

Following Test-Driven Development (TDD) best practices to build incrementally from working baseline. Break down complex features into testable, incremental implementations with proper test coverage before any code changes.

## Core Requirements

### FR-001: Establish Working Baseline
- System MUST have a minimal working backend that responds to health checks
- System MUST have basic frontend-backend communication 
- System MUST use proper TDD cycle: Test → Code → Refactor
- System MUST have passing tests before any feature additions

### FR-002: Incremental Feature Implementation
- Each feature MUST be implemented in separate branches
- Each feature MUST have tests written BEFORE implementation
- Each feature MUST pass all existing tests before merge
- System MUST maintain working state between increments

### FR-003: Agent-Based Development with Actor-Critic System
- System MUST implement agent pairs for development tasks
- Each agent MUST have a coding partner for verification

- System MUST identify synergistic aspects for creating more effective variations
- System MUST use cognitive tools (MIT/IBM) to emulate most effective approaches
- System MUST generate permutations of improvement strategies
- System MUST adapt affordances from external codebases to local capabilities

### FR-005: Daedalus-Archimedes Strategic Collaboration System
