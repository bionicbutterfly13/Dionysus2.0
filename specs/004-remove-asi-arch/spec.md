```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: Which ASI-Arch components should be removed vs preserved during the transition? ‚Üí A: Remove all ASI-Arch components completely - pipeline, database schemas, configurations, and integrations
- Q: How should existing ASI-Arch data be migrated during the transition? ‚Üí A: Discard all ASI-Arch data - start fresh with ASI-GO-2
- Q: What level of ASI-GO-2 integration should be implemented? ‚Üí A: Full replacement with deep Context Engineering integration - attractor basins, neural fields, 5-layer ThoughtSeed hierarchy, Daedalus delegation, active inference, world modeling, structure learning, and narrative pattern recognition woven throughout entire architecture

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a researcher using the Dionysus system, I want to upload documents and receive intelligent research synthesis powered by ASI-GO-2's pattern-matching capabilities, so that the system becomes smarter with each document processed and can answer complex research questions by reasoning through accumulated knowledge.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** ASI-Arch components are removed from the system, **When** a user uploads a research document, **Then** the system processes it using ASI-GO-2 without any ASI-Arch dependencies
2. **Given** ASI-GO-2 is integrated as the primary research engine, **When** a user asks a complex research question, **Then** the system uses thoughtseed competition to select optimal problem-solving patterns and synthesizes an intelligent response
3. **Given** the system has processed multiple documents, **When** a user asks follow-up questions, **Then** ASI-GO-2's cognition base demonstrates learning from previous interactions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when ASI-GO-2 components fail during research query processing?
- How does the system handle research queries that were previously handled by ASI-Arch-specific features?
- What occurs when users attempt to access removed ASI-Arch functionality?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all ASI-Arch pipeline components (evolve, eval, analyse modules)
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove ASI-Arch database dependencies and schema references
- **FR-003**: System MUST integrate ASI-GO-2's four-component architecture (Cognition Base, Researcher, Engineer, Analyst)
- **FR-004**: System MUST connect ASI-GO-2's cognition base to document processing pipeline so patterns accumulate from processed documents
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable ASI-GO-2 thoughtseed competition for research query processing
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve existing document processing capabilities while routing intelligence tasks to ASI-GO-2
- **FR-007**: System MUST completely remove all ASI-Arch configurations, settings, database schemas, and pipeline components
- **FR-008**: System MUST discard all existing ASI-Arch data and start with clean ASI-GO-2 cognition base
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement full ASI-GO-2 replacement with deep Context Engineering integration including attractor basins, neural fields, 5-layer ThoughtSeed hierarchy (sensory‚Üíperceptual‚Üíconceptual‚Üíabstract‚Üímetacognitive), Daedalus delegation patterns, active inference loops, world modeling, structure learning, concept learning, and narrative/motif pattern recognition systems
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain research intelligence quality while transitioning from ASI-Arch to ASI-GO-2

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Research Patterns**: Problem-solving strategies and approaches accumulated from document processing, stored in ASI-GO-2's cognition base
- **Problem-Solving Memory**: Episodic, semantic, and procedural memory systems that enable learning from research interactions
- **Thoughtseed Competition Workspace**: Inner workspace where competing thoughts/patterns compete for dominance during query processing
- **Document Processing Pipeline**: Data flow that connects uploaded documents to pattern extraction and cognition base updates
