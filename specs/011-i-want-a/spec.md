# Feature Specification: Consolidated Flux Interface with Unified Main Entry Point

**Feature Branch**: `011-i-want-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want a single main.py file that has everything that's needed to start the flux interface consolidated into it. I also want App here because there is one single app with some components and we treat it accordingly. I want the app to early in the process open Archimedes and open Daedalus. Archimedes implements all the content from the paper that I'm attaching and the former core code from ASI-GO. As soon as the flux front end is up it should be able to connect into all the servers that it needs. So those servers should be initialized beforehand. If the flux can't access a server, it should use a JavaScript alert window (or whatever the best practice is) to create something that lets me know what servers is having issues with. And in that error‚Äîfor exception‚Äîit should suggest my next steps or what something I can copy and paste to you and tell you where in the pipeline something has gone wrong. This may be a feature we shut off. It may be a debug feature that we shut off in production. But I want every interaction we're having to be able to look at my screen and see what's happening. Also, we use PlayWrite for debugging right now. We should also be using the Python testing framework because we're doing test-driven development. So there should be a testing class for our main so that we get everything implemented in main. Let's get this moving.Before we implement anything else, before we even start dealing with the specs, I need to see my Flux view. Just bear implementation, get it up. I don't care what is broken or what's working‚ÄîI want to see the view. I also want us to clean up all the former desktop implementation of Flux. There should be no files from the desktop implementation anywhere. If you can list them for me‚Äîall Flux that involve the desktop or that involves old implementations‚Äîso we can confirm which ones to clean out, that would be great. This is largely a cleaning mission, even as we're moving forward."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description provided and clear
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developer, System Administrator, End User
   ‚Üí Actions: Start unified app, initialize servers, display UI, handle errors, run tests, cleanup legacy files
   ‚Üí Data: Server connection status, error messages, test results
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must show immediate visual feedback, debug features configurable for production
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Paper attachment referenced but not provided]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific ASI-GO core code location and functionality]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Developer starts app ‚Üí sees Flux interface ‚Üí monitors server status
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on observable system behavior
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Main Application, Archimedes Server, Daedalus Server, Flux Interface, Legacy Files
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding paper content and ASI-GO specifics"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer needs to start the complete Flux system with a single command and immediately see the interface working. They want instant visual feedback about server connectivity status and clear guidance when issues occur. The system should provide comprehensive debugging capabilities while maintaining a clean, consolidated entry point.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system is not running, **When** developer executes the main entry point, **Then** Flux interface appears and all required servers are initialized
2. **Given** all servers are running, **When** Flux interface loads, **Then** user sees a functional interface with no error messages
3. **Given** a server is unavailable, **When** Flux attempts connection, **Then** user sees clear error notification with suggested remediation steps
4. **Given** system is in debug mode, **When** any interaction occurs, **Then** detailed status information is visible to the developer
5. **Given** legacy desktop files exist, **When** cleanup is requested, **Then** all old implementation files are identified and removable

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Archimedes server fails to start during initialization?
- How does system handle partial server connectivity (some servers up, others down)?
- What occurs when Flux interface loads but cannot establish WebSocket connections?
- How does system behave when switching between debug and production modes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single main entry point that starts the complete Flux application
- **FR-002**: System MUST initialize Archimedes and Daedalus servers before presenting the user interface
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the Flux interface immediately upon successful startup
- **FR-004**: System MUST check connectivity to all required servers and report status to user
- **FR-005**: System MUST display clear error notifications when server connections fail
- **FR-006**: Error messages MUST include specific remediation steps or copy-pasteable diagnostic information
- **FR-007**: System MUST support a debug mode that provides detailed operational visibility
- **FR-008**: Debug mode MUST be configurable to disable in production environments
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with Playwright for debugging capabilities
- **FR-010**: System MUST include comprehensive test coverage using Python testing framework
- **FR-011**: System MUST identify all legacy desktop implementation files for cleanup
- **FR-012**: Archimedes server MUST implement [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific paper content not provided]
- **FR-013**: Archimedes server MUST integrate [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ASI-GO core code location and specific functionality not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Main Application**: Central entry point coordinating all system components and user interface presentation
- **Archimedes Server**: Service implementing research paper content and ASI-GO core functionality
- **Daedalus Server**: Supporting service providing additional system capabilities
- **Flux Interface**: Primary user interface displaying system status and providing interaction capabilities
- **Server Connection Status**: Real-time connectivity state for each required service
- **Error Notifications**: User-facing messages with diagnostic information and remediation guidance
- **Legacy Files**: Outdated desktop implementation files requiring identification and removal
