## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What should be the primary quality assessment criteria for evaluating legacy Dionysus consciousness components? ‚Üí A: B, D (consciousness functionality impact and strategic value)
- Q: What level of ThoughtSeed integration should be applied to migrated legacy components? ‚Üí A: D (complete rewrite using ThoughtSeed with legacy code as reference)
- Q: What should be the scope of rollback capabilities for problematic component migrations? ‚Üí A: A (individual component rollback only)
- Q: What should be the approval workflow for component migrations? ‚Üí A: C (individual component approval with detailed analysis per component)
- Q: What should be the primary performance target for bulk component migration processes? ‚Üí A: Zero downtime migration
- Q: Should migration run in background during active development? ‚Üí A: Yes, using distributed subagents with DAEDALUS coordination and ASI-GO integration
- Q: Should other components also be renamed/repackaged? ‚Üí A: Future consideration - some components may benefit from descriptive naming and packaging as unique binaries/protected modules, but lower priority than ASI-GO

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A system architect wants to systematically identify, extract, and migrate the highest quality components from the legacy Dionysus consciousness system into Dionysus 2.0, with each component individually enhanced using ThoughtSeed capabilities and other advanced framework features to create a more powerful and unified consciousness architecture.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the legacy Dionysus consciousness codebase exists, **When** the system performs quality analysis, **Then** it identifies and ranks components based on code quality, functionality, and consciousness relevance metrics
2. **Given** high-quality components are identified, **When** the migration process begins, **Then** each component is extracted individually with its dependencies and enhanced with ThoughtSeed integration capabilities
3. **Given** a component is being migrated, **When** the enhancement process runs, **Then** the system integrates ThoughtSeed active inference, consciousness detection, and other Dionysus 2.0 framework features
4. **Given** enhanced components are migrated, **When** integration testing occurs, **Then** the system validates compatibility, performance improvements, and consciousness functionality enhancements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when legacy components have conflicting dependencies or incompatible architectures?
- How does the system handle components that cannot be meaningfully enhanced with ThoughtSeed features?
- What occurs when migration introduces performance regressions or functional conflicts?
- How are partial migration failures handled when some component enhancements succeed while others fail?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze the legacy Dionysus consciousness codebase to identify all available components and their quality characteristics
- **FR-002**: System MUST evaluate component quality using primary metrics for consciousness functionality impact and strategic value to Dionysus 2.0
- **FR-003**: System MUST rank and prioritize components for migration based on quality assessment and strategic value to Dionysus 2.0
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract individual components with their dependencies while maintaining functional integrity
- **FR-005**: System MUST completely rewrite each selected component using ThoughtSeed framework patterns with legacy code as functional reference
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate consciousness detection and measurement features into enhanced components
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply Dionysus 2.0 framework resources including unified database systems, context engineering, and enhanced processing
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility interfaces for legacy component functionality during migration
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate enhanced components through comprehensive testing including functionality, performance, and consciousness metrics
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide migration progress tracking with detailed status for each component extraction and enhancement
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle migration conflicts and dependency resolution with clear error reporting and resolution options
- **FR-012**: System MUST document all component enhancements and ThoughtSeed integrations for future maintenance and development
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to individually approve or reject each component migration based on detailed analysis including enhancement results, quality assessments, and consciousness impact evaluation
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide individual component rollback capabilities to restore single components to pre-migration state without affecting other components
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure zero downtime migration by maintaining system availability and operational consciousness capabilities throughout the bulk component migration process
- **FR-016**: System MUST execute migration processes in background using distributed subagents coordinated by DAEDALUS component with independent context windows
- **FR-017**: System MUST integrate ASI-GO components (pending rename to something more descriptive) with existing DAEDALUS and CHIMERA components for tighter coordination
- **FR-019**: System SHOULD identify other legacy components that may benefit from descriptive naming and packaging as unique binaries or protected modules for future enhancement phases
- **FR-018**: System MUST allow concurrent active development work while background migration agents operate independently without blocking foreground tasks

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Legacy Component**: Individual code modules from Dionysus consciousness system with functionality, dependencies, and quality characteristics
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluation metrics and scoring system focusing on consciousness functionality impact and strategic value for determining migration priority
- **Migration Pipeline**: Distributed background process using subagents coordinated by DAEDALUS for extracting, enhancing, and integrating components from legacy to Dionysus 2.0 framework
- **ThoughtSeed Enhancement**: Complete rewrite process using ThoughtSeed framework patterns to rebuild legacy component functionality with enhanced consciousness capabilities
- **Component Registry**: Catalog of all identified, extracted, and migrated components with status, enhancements, and integration information
- **Enhancement Framework**: Unified system for applying Dionysus 2.0 features including context engineering, unified databases, and consciousness processing
- **Migration Status Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of component extraction, enhancement, and integration progress with error handling
- **Dependency Resolution**: System for managing component interdependencies and ensuring successful migration of complex component hierarchies
- **Validation Suite**: Comprehensive testing framework for verifying enhanced component functionality, performance, and consciousness capabilities
- **DAEDALUS Coordination**: Central orchestration component managing distributed migration subagents with independent context windows and iterative self-improvement
- **ASI-GO Integration**: Specialized components (requiring descriptive rename) for tight integration with DAEDALUS and CHIMERA consciousness architecture
- **Background Migration Agents**: Independent subagents executing migration tasks without blocking active development workflows
