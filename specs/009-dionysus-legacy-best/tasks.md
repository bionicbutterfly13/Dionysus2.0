# Tasks: Dionysus Legacy Component Migration with ThoughtSeed Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/009-dionysus-legacy-best/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/migration-api.yaml, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Python 3.11+, ThoughtSeed, DAEDALUS, CHIMERA, Neo4j, Redis
   → Structure: Single project (consciousness system migration tool)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 7 core entities → model tasks
   → contracts/migration-api.yaml: 8 endpoints → contract test tasks
   → quickstart.md: 5 validation scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category following TDD principles
4. Apply parallel execution rules for independent files
5. Number tasks sequentially with dependency ordering
6. Validate completeness and parallel execution safety
```

- Contract tests (T006-T013) before any implementation
- Integration tests (T014-T018) before core implementation
- Models (T019-T025) before services (T026-T032)
- Services before API endpoints (T033-T040)
- Core implementation before integration (T044-T053)

## Notes
- [P] tasks target different files and have no dependencies
- Verify all tests fail before implementing corresponding functionality
- Commit after each completed task for rollback safety
- Consciousness metrics must be validated at each integration point
- DAEDALUS coordination requires independent context window verification

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- [x] All contracts (8 endpoints) have corresponding contract tests (T006-T013)
- [x] All entities (7 core models) have model creation tasks (T019-T025)
- [x] All tests (T006-T018) come before implementation (T019+)
- [x] Parallel tasks [P] target different files with no dependencies
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path for implementation
- [x] No [P] task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Integration tests cover all quickstart validation scenarios
- [x] Zero downtime and rollback requirements addressed in infrastructure tasks

**Total Tasks**: 67 tasks with clear dependency ordering and parallel execution opportunities
**Estimated Timeline**: 6-8 weeks with parallel execution and proper TDD approach
**Critical Success Factors**: Zero downtime validation, consciousness metrics preservation, DAEDALUS coordination efficiency
