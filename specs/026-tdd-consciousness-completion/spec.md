# Spec 026: TDD Consciousness Implementation Completion

## Summary
Complete the TDD cycle for consciousness orchestrator by implementing remaining methods to achieve 100% test pass rate and enter Refactor phase.

## User Story
As a consciousness system developer, I want all TDD tests to pass so that the consciousness orchestrator meets all specified requirements and can enter the refactor phase for optimization.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-026-001: Complete TDD Green Phase
- Implement missing ConsciousnessEngine methods to pass all tests
- Add get_consciousness_state() method
- Add active_inference_processor integration
- Add update_consciousness_state() method

### FR-026-002: Error Handling and Resilience
- Graceful error handling for malformed input
- Fallback modes when components unavailable
- Comprehensive error messages with debugging info
- Recovery mechanisms for failed consciousness stages

### FR-026-003: Performance Optimization
- Consciousness processing within 500ms requirement
- Memory usage limits enforcement
- Efficient ThoughtSeed population management
- Optimized attractor calculations

### FR-026-004: Integration Validation
- End-to-end consciousness processing tests
- Daedalus Gateway integration verification
- Memory formation validation
- Agent context preparation testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 100% test pass rate for consciousness orchestrator
- [ ] All TDD requirements implemented and verified
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases and failures
- [ ] Performance requirements met under load
- [ ] Integration tests pass with all components

## Dependencies
- Spec-022: Consciousness orchestrator TDD test suite
- ThoughtSeed competition implementation
- LangGraph StateGraph consciousness pipeline
- Daedalus Gateway integration
