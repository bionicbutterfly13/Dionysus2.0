# Spec 024: Modular Consciousness Pipeline Architecture

## Summary
Build production-ready modular consciousness pipeline with clean separation of concerns, dependency injection, and pluggable consciousness stages.

## User Story
As a consciousness system developer, I want a modular pipeline architecture so that consciousness stages can be developed, tested, and deployed independently while maintaining system coherence.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-024-001: Modular Stage Architecture
- Each consciousness stage (perception, competition, attention, etc.) as independent module
- Standardized stage interface with input/output contracts
- Dependency injection for stage configuration

### FR-024-002: Pipeline Orchestration
- LangGraph-based pipeline with configurable stage ordering
- Conditional branching based on consciousness state
- Parallel processing capabilities for independent stages

### FR-024-003: Stage Plugin System
- Dynamic loading of consciousness stages
- Stage versioning and compatibility checking
- Hot-swapping of stages without pipeline restart

### FR-024-004: Testing Framework
- Unit tests for individual consciousness stages
- Integration tests for stage interactions
- Performance benchmarking for pipeline stages

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Consciousness stages implemented as independent modules
- [ ] Pipeline supports stage plugin loading
- [ ] TDD test coverage > 90% for all stages
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet spec requirements
- [ ] Documentation for stage development

## Dependencies
- Spec-022: Consciousness orchestrator base implementation
- Spec-023: Context engineering integration
- LangGraph StateGraph architecture
