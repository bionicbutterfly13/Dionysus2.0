# Tasks: Archimedes-Daedalus Synergistic System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/019-archimedes-daedalus-synergistic-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), ARCHIMEDES_DAEDALUS_SYNERGISTIC_SYSTEM_SPEC.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Python 3.11, ASI GoTo integration, Redis/Neo4j storage
2. Load specification document:
   → Extract entities: ArchimedesCore, DaedalusAgentOrchestrator, SemanticAffordanceEngine
   → Extract contracts: solve_novel_problem, match_problem_to_agents, create_specialized_agent
   → Extract user stories: novel problem recognition, agent specialization, committee reasoning
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, database connections
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, component tests
   → Core: Archimedes core, Daedalus orchestrator, semantic matching
   → Integration: ASI GoTo integration, cognitive tools, committee reasoning
   → Polish: performance optimization, documentation, validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different modules = mark [P] for parallel
   → Shared components = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
```

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies
- **TDD Critical**: All tests T006-T012 must fail before implementing T013+
- **Performance Requirements**: Pattern matching ≤100ms, agent matching ≤500ms, committee formation ≤2s
- **Integration Focus**: Preserve ASI GoTo functionality while adding Archimedes-Daedalus enhancements
- **Semantic Foundation**: Use existing Vector Database system for embeddings and similarity calculations
- **Cognitive Tools**: Implement IBM-validated cognitive tools from arXiv:2506.12115v1

## Task Generation Rules

1. **From Specification Components**:
   - Each major class → implementation task
   - Each user story → integration test [P]
   - Each performance requirement → performance test [P]
   
2. **From System Architecture**:
   - Each service → independent implementation [P]
   - Each integration point → integration task
   - Each storage system → storage integration task [P]
   
3. **From Success Criteria**:
   - Pattern recognition accuracy → validation task
   - Response time requirements → performance tests [P]
   - Throughput requirements → load tests [P]

4. **Ordering Strategy**:
   - TDD: Tests → Models → Services → Integration → Orchestration
   - Dependencies: Data models before services, services before orchestrators
   - Parallel: Different modules/files can run concurrently
