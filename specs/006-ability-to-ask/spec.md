# Feature Specification: Research Engine Query Interface

**Feature Branch**: `006-ability-to-ask`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ability to ask the research engine a question and haave it search my comprehensive neo4j and vector database to create a well constructed response"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves natural language question processing for database search
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: researchers/users, Actions: ask questions, receive responses
   ‚Üí Data: Neo4j graph database, vector database, research content
   ‚Üí Constraints: responses must be well-constructed and comprehensive
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question complexity limits and supported formats]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: response formatting and length requirements]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user authentication and access control]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: user asks question ‚Üí system searches ‚Üí returns response
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Question processing, database querying, response synthesis
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Questions, Search Results, Responses, Database Connections
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding question formats and response requirements"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher wants to ask complex questions about their research data and receive comprehensive, well-structured answers that combine information from both graph relationships and semantic similarity searches across their comprehensive database.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has access to the research engine, **When** they submit a natural language question about their research domain, **Then** the system searches both Neo4j and vector databases and returns a comprehensive response combining relevant findings
2. **Given** a user asks a question that spans multiple research topics, **When** the system processes the query, **Then** it identifies related concepts across different data sources and synthesizes a coherent response
3. **Given** a user submits a vague or ambiguous question, **When** the system processes it, **Then** it provides clarifying questions or interprets the intent and explains its interpretation in the response

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the question has no relevant matches in either database?
- How does the system handle questions that exceed processing limits or are malformed?
- What occurs when database connections are unavailable during query processing?
- How are conflicting information from different sources reconciled in responses?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language questions from users through a query interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST search both Neo4j graph database and vector database simultaneously for relevant information
- **FR-003**: System MUST synthesize search results from multiple data sources into coherent, well-structured responses
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle questions of varying complexity and scope within the research domain
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide informative responses even when partial matches are found
- **FR-006**: System MUST indicate confidence levels or source reliability in responses
- **FR-007**: System MUST log all queries and responses for analysis and improvement
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to follow up with clarifying questions based on initial responses
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle concurrent user queries efficiently [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected concurrent user load not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST authenticate and authorize users before processing queries [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method and user roles not specified]
- **FR-011**: System MUST format responses in a readable, structured manner [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific formatting requirements not detailed]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide response time within acceptable limits [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance targets not specified]
- **FR-013**: Response synthesis MUST use a consciousness-aware LLM generation step (local Ollama models by default, configurable remote provider with explicit opt-in) that weaves retrieved evidence into coherent answers with inline provenance. Template-only or placeholder strings are prohibited; automated TDD scenarios MUST assert that synthesized answers (a) exceed 200 characters for integration fixtures, (b) include at least one cited source from Neo4j or the vector index, and (c) degrade gracefully with clearly messaged fallbacks if the preferred LLM is unavailable.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Question**: User-submitted natural language query with metadata (timestamp, user, complexity)
- **Search Result**: Information retrieved from databases with relevance scores and source attribution
- **Response**: Synthesized answer combining multiple search results with structure and formatting
- **Database Connection**: Active connections to Neo4j and vector databases with health status
- **User Session**: Context for follow-up questions and query history within a research session
- **Query Log**: Historical record of questions and responses for system improvement and analytics
