## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A researcher wants to explore how neural architectures evolve and develop consciousness-like properties over time. They need to understand the relationships between architectural patterns, episodic learning experiences, and archetypal behaviors that emerge during the search process. The system should provide a unified view of all these interconnected concepts without requiring access to multiple separate databases.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a newly discovered neural architecture, **When** the researcher queries for similar architectures, **Then** the system returns architectures with related patterns, consciousness levels, and episodic contexts
2. **Given** an architecture showing consciousness emergence, **When** the researcher explores its development path, **Then** the system shows the complete evolution timeline with episodic memories and archetypal transitions
3. **Given** a research question about archetypal patterns, **When** the researcher searches by narrative description, **Then** the system finds relevant architectures and episodes that exhibit those patterns
4. **Given** multiple related architectures, **When** the researcher analyzes their relationships, **Then** the system reveals evolution paths, similarity clusters, and consciousness development patterns

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an architecture has no clear evolutionary predecessor?
- How does the system handle architectures with multiple simultaneous archetypal patterns?
- What occurs when consciousness metrics are missing or inconsistent?
- How does the system maintain relationship integrity when architectures are updated?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST store neural architecture data with complete metadata including performance, structure, and behavioral characteristics
- **FR-002**: System MUST track consciousness emergence indicators and evolution over time for each architecture
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve episodic memory contexts that capture the narrative of architecture development
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain archetypal pattern associations and their resonance strengths
- **FR-005**: System MUST support relationship queries that span multiple entity types (architecture-episode-archetype-consciousness)
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable similarity searches based on architectural patterns, consciousness levels, and narrative content
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide complete evolution path tracking from ancestor to descendant architectures
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain data consistency and referential integrity across all entity relationships
- **FR-009**: System MUST support full-text narrative search across architecture descriptions and episodic summaries
- **FR-010**: System MUST enable temporal analysis of consciousness development across the entire architecture population
- **FR-011**: System MUST consolidate all neural architecture data from existing separate storage systems
- **FR-012**: System MUST eliminate data duplication while preserving all historical information and relationships

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Architecture**: Represents a neural network design with performance metrics, consciousness indicators, and structural properties
- **Episode**: Captures a narrative segment of architecture development with temporal boundaries and archetypal context
- **ConsciousnessState**: Records consciousness emergence indicators, self-awareness markers, and meta-cognitive depth for an architecture
- **Archetype**: Represents archetypal patterns (Hero, Sage, Creator, etc.) with resonance criteria and psychological markers
- **EvolutionPath**: Tracks parent-child relationships and transformation sequences between architectures
- **NarrativePattern**: Captures recurring story elements and motifs that appear across multiple episodes
- **ContextStream**: Represents information flow dynamics in the river metaphor framework
- **AttractorBasin**: Models stable states and their attraction dynamics in the consciousness landscape
