# Implementation Plan: Neo4j Unified Knowledge Graph Schema Implementation

**Branch**: `001-neo4j-unified-knowledge` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-neo4j-unified-knowledge/spec.md`

## Summary
Migrate ALL data from multiple database systems (MongoDB, FAISS, SQLite+JSON hybrid) into a unified Neo4j graph database + vector database system. This is a lifelong accumulation system expecting 10,000+ neural architectures. Success criteria: complete data migration with preserved functionality, plus the system can use old solutions to generate new ones through comparison and mutation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11  
**Primary Dependencies**: Neo4j 5.x, atlas-rag (AutoSchemaKG), networkx, sentence-transformers  
**Storage**: Neo4j graph database + integrated vector indexing  
**Testing**: pytest with Neo4j test containers, data integrity validation  
**Target Platform**: macOS development, scalable to cloud deployment  
**Project Type**: single (database migration + API layer)  
**Performance Goals**: Handle 10,000+ architectures, fast similarity queries for solution mutation  
**Constraints**: Zero data loss during migration, all existing functionality preserved  
**Scale/Scope**: Lifelong accumulation system, tens of thousands of neural architectures expected

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity Check**: ✅ PASS
- Consolidating 3 separate systems into 1 unified system (reducing complexity)
- Using established Neo4j + vector patterns (not inventing new approaches)

**Data Integrity Check**: ✅ PASS  
- Migration includes comprehensive validation tests
- Rollback plan maintains original data until verification complete

**Structure Decision**: Single project (database migration with unified API layer)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Identified:
1. **Neo4j Vector Integration**: Research Neo4j 5.x native vector indexing capabilities vs external vector DB
2. **Migration Patterns**: Best practices for zero-downtime database migrations with validation
3. **AutoSchemaKG Integration**: How to automatically map existing data to graph relationships
4. **Data Integrity Validation**: Patterns for ensuring 100% data preservation during migration
5. **Performance Optimization**: Neo4j indexing strategies for 10,000+ node graphs with vector similarity

### Research Questions to Answer:
- Neo4j native vector indexing vs separate vector database - which approach for our scale?
- Migration validation strategies - how to prove 100% data transfer accuracy?
- AutoSchemaKG integration patterns - automatic relationship discovery from existing data
- Performance benchmarking - what indexes/constraints needed for 10k+ architectures?

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions and rationale documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Migration Strategy:
1. **Extract entities** from existing systems:
   - MongoDB: Neural architectures, performance metrics, evolution data
   - FAISS: Vector embeddings and similarity relationships  
   - SQLite+JSON: Consciousness states, episodes, autobiographical events, context streams

2. **Map to unified graph schema**:
   - Architecture nodes with embedded vectors
   - Episode nodes with narrative content
   - Consciousness state relationships
   - Evolution path relationships
   - Archetypal pattern connections

3. **Generate migration contracts**:
   - Data extraction APIs from each source system
   - Transformation and validation pipeline contracts
   - Neo4j insertion and relationship creation contracts
   - Rollback and recovery contracts

4. **Create validation tests**:
   - Data count verification (source vs target)
   - Relationship integrity checks
   - Query result comparison (old vs new system)
   - Performance benchmark validation

**Output**: data-model.md, migration contracts, validation test framework, quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Migration pipeline tasks: Extract → Transform → Load → Validate
- Each data source (MongoDB, FAISS, SQLite) → separate extraction task [P]
- Each entity type → transformation and validation task [P]
- Integration tests for cross-system queries
- Performance benchmarking tasks
- Rollback procedure tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Parallel extraction from all source systems [P]
- Sequential transformation (dependencies between entity types)
- Validation after each major entity migration
- Final integration tests and performance validation

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks focused on complete data migration with validation
