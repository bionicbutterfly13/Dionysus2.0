    User clarified the true vision: Not just data migration, but creating a Thoughtseed-based 
    ASI system that implements integrated world model theory with active inference and attractor 
    basins. The system should use our context engineering library (river metaphor, consciousness 
    detection, episodic memory) as the cognitive substrate for enhanced neural architecture search.
    
    Key insight: These design conversations must become part of the system's meta-learning through 
    episodic memory, ensuring continuity across terminal sessions.
