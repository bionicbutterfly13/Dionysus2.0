Climate Change and Global Warming

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns.
Since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily
due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

Greenhouse gases trap heat in Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming. The main
greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).

Effects of climate change include:
- Rising sea levels
- Extreme weather events (hurricanes, droughts, floods)
- Melting polar ice caps and glaciers
- Ocean acidification
- Ecosystem disruption and species extinction
- Changes in agricultural productivity

Mitigation strategies focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy,
energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, and carbon capture technologies.

Adaptation measures include building climate-resilient infrastructure, developing
drought-resistant crops, and implementing early warning systems for extreme weather.
