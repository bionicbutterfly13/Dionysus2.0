Demo: LogFire vs Standard Logging for ThoughtSeed Debugging
==========================================================

Shows the difference between our current logging and LogFire enhanced observability.

Run this to see:
1. Standard approach with print statements
2. LogFire enhanced with hierarchical traces, structured data, live view

To install LogFire: pip install logfire pydantic
