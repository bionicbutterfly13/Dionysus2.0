Test-Driven Development for ASI-GO-2 Cognitive Core
==================================================

These tests WILL FAIL initially - that's the point of TDD!
We write failing tests first, then implement code to make them pass.

Test hierarchy matches our spec hierarchy:
- Test CognitionBase (memory system)
- Test Pattern storage and retrieval
- Test InnerWorkspace (thoughtseed competition)
- Test ThoughtGenerator and ThoughtType
