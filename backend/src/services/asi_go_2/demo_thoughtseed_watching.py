Demo: Complete ThoughtSeed Watching System
==========================================

Demonstrates the full watching capability integrated with ASI-GO-2 Researcher.
Shows how the original specification requirements are met:

- Toggle watching on/off for specific ThoughtSeed instances
- Capture comprehensive state during competition cycles
- 10-minute Redis TTL for log retention
- ISO8601 millisecond timestamps
- Integration with existing ASI-GO-2 Researcher component
