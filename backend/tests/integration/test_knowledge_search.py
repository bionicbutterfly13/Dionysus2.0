        # Neural Networks and Consciousness Research

        Neural networks are computational models that simulate biological neural
        systems. Deep learning utilizes hierarchical layers to learn complex
        representations. Consciousness emerges from complex neural interactions
        that integrate information across distributed brain networks.

        Key researchers in this field include Geoffrey Hinton (deep learning),
        Yoshua Bengio (neural networks), and Giulio Tononi (consciousness theory).
        The Global Workspace Theory by Bernard Baars explains how consciousness
        arises from global information integration across brain modules.

        Technical concepts:
        - Backpropagation: Training algorithm for neural networks
        - Attention mechanisms: Focus computation on relevant information
        - Transformer architecture: Attention-based neural network design
        - Integrated Information Theory (IIT): Mathematical framework for consciousness
        - Recurrent neural networks: Networks with temporal dynamics
        - Convolutional neural networks: Networks for spatial pattern recognition

        Research institutions advancing this work include MIT's Computer Science
        and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Stanford's Human-Centered
        AI Institute, and the Consciousness and Cognition Laboratory at Cambridge.

        Applications span autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, natural language
        processing, computer vision, and cognitive modeling.

        # Consciousness and Information Integration

        Consciousness represents the subjective experience of being aware.
        Integrated Information Theory (IIT) proposes that consciousness
        corresponds to integrated information (Φ) in a system. Higher Φ
        values indicate greater consciousness.

        Key principles of IIT:
        1. Information: Consciousness corresponds to integrated information
        2. Integration: Conscious systems cannot be decomposed into independent parts
        3. Exclusion: Consciousness has definite boundaries and grain
        4. Intrinsic existence: Consciousness exists intrinsically, not relationally

        Related theories include:
        - Global Workspace Theory: Consciousness as global information broadcast
        - Higher-Order Thought Theory: Consciousness requires thoughts about thoughts
        - Predictive Processing: Consciousness emerges from prediction error minimization
        - Attention Schema Theory: Consciousness as model of attention

        Experimental methods for studying consciousness:
        - Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI): Measures consciousness levels
        - No-report paradigms: Study consciousness without confounding reports
        - Binocular rivalry: Investigate conscious perception dynamics
        - Masking experiments: Probe threshold of conscious awareness

        Neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) include:
        - Gamma oscillations: High-frequency brain rhythms
        - Posterior cingulate cortex: Default mode network hub
        - Thalamic nuclei: Consciousness on/off switches
        - Frontoparietal networks: Executive consciousness control

        # ThoughtSeed Framework Architecture

        The ThoughtSeed framework implements a 5-layer hierarchical processing
        system: sensorimotor, perceptual, conceptual, abstract, and metacognitive.
        Each layer processes information at increasing levels of abstraction.

        Attractor basin dynamics follow the mathematical foundation:
        φ_i(x) = σ_i · exp(-||x - c_i||² / (2r_i²))

        where σ_i is the strength parameter, c_i represents center coordinates,
        and r_i is the radius of the attractor basin.

        Neural field evolution is governed by the PDE:
        ∂ψ/∂t = i(∇²ψ + α|ψ|²ψ)

        where ψ is the neural field, α is the nonlinearity coefficient,
        and ∇² is the Laplacian operator.

        The system integrates with Redis for caching (TTL: 24h neuronal packets,
        7d attractor basins, 30d results) and Neo4j for graph storage with
        384-dimensional vector embeddings.

        Research integration points include MIT MEM1 memory consolidation,
        IBM Zurich neural efficiency metrics, and Shanghai AI Lab active
        inference precision measurements.
