  "title": "Thoughtseed-Based ASI with Integrated World Model Theory Design Discussion",
  "narrative_summary": "\n    User clarified the true vision: Not just data migration, but creating a Thoughtseed-based \n    ASI system that implements integrated world model theory with active inference and attractor \n    basins. The system should use our context engineering library (river metaphor, consciousness \n    detection, episodic memory) as the cognitive substrate for enhanced neural architecture search.\n    \n    Key insight: These design conversations must become part of the system's meta-learning through \n    episodic memory, ensuring continuity across terminal sessions.\n    ",
