## Constitutional Compliance

All 4 specs enforce AGENT_CONSTITUTION §2.2:

- ✅ NO direct neo4j imports in backend
- ✅ Audit trail (caller_service, caller_function) on all operations
- ✅ Integration tests verifying Graph Channel usage
- ✅ Spec 057 E2E tests validate constitutional compliance

Per Spec 040 M3 governance (committed 92170c86):
- Pre-commit hooks will block direct neo4j imports
- CI checks will fail builds with violations
- Linter detects banned imports (CONST001/CONST002 errors)
- Regression tests prevent backsliding

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Before Implementation)

1. **Run /clarify on each spec** to resolve ambiguities:
   ```bash
   # For each spec branch:
   git checkout 054-document-persistence-repository
   # Run: /clarify

   git checkout 054-knowledge-graph-processing
   # Run: /clarify

   git checkout 054-frontend-live-data
   # Run: /clarify

   git checkout 054-end-to-end
   # Run: /clarify
   ```

2. **Run /plan on each spec** after clarifications:
   - Generates implementation design
   - Creates architecture diagrams
   - Identifies technical risks

3. **Run /tasks on each spec** to create actionable work items:
   - Breaks down into subtasks
   - Estimates effort
   - Assigns priorities

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1**: Spec 054 - Document Persistence
- Estimated: 2-3 weeks
- Blockers: None (Spec 040 already complete)
- Deliverable: Working persistence layer + listing API

**Phase 2**: Spec 055 - Knowledge Graph APIs
- Estimated: 2 weeks
- Blockers: Phase 1 complete
- Deliverable: Graph query APIs + timeline endpoints

**Phase 3**: Spec 056 - Frontend Live Data

## Conclusion

All four specifications for the "Real Data Frontend" initiative have been successfully created using the spec-kit workflow. Each spec:

✅ Follows spec-template.md structure
✅ Identifies Context Engineering integration opportunities
✅ Marks ambiguities for clarification

✅ Specifies measurable performance targets
✅ Enforces constitutional compliance

**Ready for /clarify phase** - Implementation can begin after clarifications resolved.
