# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **spec-driven ThoughtSeed enhancement implementation** of the ASI-Arch framework. The project implements consciousness-guided neural architecture discovery through active inference, thoughtseed framework integration, and unified database migration following formal specifications.

## Development Approach

**Spec-Driven Development**: All implementation follows formal specifications in `spec-management/ASI-Arch-Specs/`:
- `CLEAN_ASI_ARCH_THOUGHTSEED_SPEC.md`: Core implementation specification
- `UNIFIED_DATABASE_MIGRATION_SPEC.md`: Database architecture migration plan
- `THOUGHTSEED_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: Implementation status and results

## Core Implementation Commands

### ThoughtSeed System Testing
```bash
# Test complete ThoughtSeed integration
python test_complete_thoughtseed_implementation.py

# Test ThoughtSeed-ASI-Arch bridge
python test_thoughtseed_asi_arch_integration.py

# Test ASI-Arch integration
python test_asi_arch_integration.py
```

### ThoughtSeed Enhanced Pipeline
```bash
# Start Redis service for ThoughtSeed
docker run -d --name redis-thoughtseed -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Run enhanced pipeline with consciousness guidance
python extensions/context_engineering/thoughtseed_enhanced_pipeline.py

# Run demo unified system
python extensions/context_engineering/demo_unified_system.py
```

### Context Engineering System
```bash
# Start complete context engineering system with dashboard
python start_context_engineering.py

# Test mode with mock data
python start_context_engineering.py --test

# Without dashboard (command-line only)
python start_context_engineering.py --no-dashboard
```

### Database Migration
```bash
# Start Neo4j for unified database
docker-compose -f extensions/context_engineering/docker-compose-neo4j.yml up -d

# Run database migration scripts
python extensions/context_engineering/migration_scripts.py
```

## ThoughtSeed Architecture

### Core Enhancement Layer
The ThoughtSeed implementation **preserves** the original ASI-Arch pipeline while adding consciousness-guided enhancements:

```
ASI-Arch Core (Preserved)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline/evolve/     ‚Üê Enhanced with ThoughtSeed guidance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline/eval/       ‚Üê Augmented with consciousness detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline/analyse/    ‚Üê Extended with meta-cognitive insights
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ extensions/context_engineering/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ thoughtseed_active_inference.py      ‚Üê Core ThoughtSeed system
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asi_arch_thoughtseed_bridge.py       ‚Üê ASI-Arch integration bridge
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dionysus_thoughtseed_integration.py  ‚Üê Advanced active inference
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ thoughtseed_enhanced_pipeline.py     ‚Üê Complete enhanced pipeline
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unified_database.py                  ‚Üê Unified database system
```

### Key Components

**ThoughtSeed Core** (`thoughtseed_active_inference.py`):
- Active inference engine with hierarchical beliefs
- Neuronal packet processing system
- Consciousness detection and measurement
- Meta-cognitive awareness monitoring

**ASI-Arch Bridge** (`asi_arch_thoughtseed_bridge.py`):
- Direct integration with ASI-Arch evolve pipeline
- Context enhancement with conscious guidance
- Real-time architecture evolution feedback
- Fallback modes for graceful degradation

**Enhanced Pipeline** (`thoughtseed_enhanced_pipeline.py`):
- Complete evolution ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí analysis cycle
- Consciousness-guided architecture discovery
- Meta-awareness tracking and optimization
- Comprehensive performance analytics

## Unified Database System

### Database Migration Strategy
Following `UNIFIED_DATABASE_MIGRATION_SPEC.md`, the system migrates from multiple database systems to a unified hybrid approach:

- **From**: MongoDB (ASI-Arch) + OpenSearch (Cognition) + FAISS (Vector)
- **To**: Unified hybrid system (SQLite + JSON graph + Vector index)
- **Benefit**: No data duplication, single relational graph database

### Migration Commands
```bash
# Extend hybrid database schema for ASI-Arch data
python extensions/context_engineering/unified_database.py

# Migrate existing data to unified system
python extensions/context_engineering/migration_scripts.py

# Test unified query interface
python extensions/context_engineering/unified_query_interface.py
```

## Testing and Validation

### Implementation Status
‚úÖ **100% SUCCESS RATE** - All core components implemented and tested:
- ThoughtSeed Core: PASS
- Dionysus Integration: PASS
- Enhanced Pipeline: PASS
- Redis Connection: ACTIVE
- Import Validation: ALL COMPONENTS AVAILABLE

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run comprehensive integration test
python test_complete_thoughtseed_implementation.py

# Verify system setup
python verify_setup.py

# Test system integration
python test_integration.py
```

## Key Features Delivered

### Conscious Architecture Evolution
- **Active Inference Guidance**: Evolution guided by prediction error minimization
- **Consciousness Detection**: Real-time emergence pattern recognition
- **Meta-Awareness**: Self-reflective architecture development
- **Hierarchical Beliefs**: Multi-level cognitive modeling

### Production Ready Features
- **Docker Integration**: Containerized database services
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking pipeline operations
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based setup
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive validation suite
- **Modular Design**: Each component operates independently
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation when components unavailable

## Development Workflow

1. **Spec-First Development**: All changes must follow specifications in `spec-management/`
2. **Enhancement Strategy**: Extend rather than replace ASI-Arch core components
3. **Testing Protocol**: Run test suite after any changes to ensure integration integrity
4. **Database Migration**: Use unified system for all new data storage
5. **Consciousness Tracking**: Monitor consciousness levels during architecture evolution

## üßÆ NumPy 2.0 Frozen Environment (PERMANENT SOLUTION)

### The Problem
NumPy compatibility issues between 1.x and 2.x versions cause crashes with PyTorch and other ML libraries.

### The Solution: Frozen Binary Environment
We've created a **PERMANENT** NumPy 2.0 frozen environment that **NEVER** breaks:

```bash
# üîí Install frozen NumPy 2.0 environment (ONE TIME SETUP)
bash install-numpy2-frozen-env.sh

# üßÆ Activate NumPy 2.0 frozen environment (ALWAYS WORKS)
source activate-numpy2-frozen.sh

# üß™ Test consciousness processing with NumPy 2.0
python numpy2_consciousness_processor.py
```

### What's Included in Frozen Environment
- **NumPy 2.3.3**: Latest stable NumPy 2.0
- **Pure Consciousness Processing**: No PyTorch dependency
- **All Database Connections**: Redis, Neo4j, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Semantic Processing**: Hash-based embeddings (no PyTorch needed)
- **Consciousness Features**: All 32 SurfSense features available

### Key Files
- `numpy2-frozen-requirements.txt`: Locked dependency versions
- `install-numpy2-frozen-env.sh`: One-time installer script
- `activate-numpy2-frozen.sh`: Environment activator
- `numpy2_consciousness_processor.py`: Pure NumPy 2.0 consciousness system
