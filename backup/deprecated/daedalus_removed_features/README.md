# Daedalus Removed Features Archive

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Spec**: 021-remove-all-that
**Reason**: Simplification to single responsibility (perceptual information gateway)

## Overview
This directory archives functionality removed from the Daedalus class during the Spec 021 cleanup. These methods violated the single responsibility principle and were removed to create a clean, focused gateway implementation.

## Removed Methods

The following 12 methods were removed from Daedalus:

### 1. `process_document(document: Dict) -> Dict`
**Purpose**: Document processing and analysis
**Removed Because**: Processing should be handled by specialized services, not the gateway
**Replacement**: LangGraph agents handle document processing

### 2. `analyze_content(content: str) -> Dict`
**Purpose**: Content analysis and feature extraction
**Removed Because**: Analysis is a separate concern from data reception
**Replacement**: Dedicated analysis services in the pipeline

### 3. `extract_features(data: bytes) -> List[Dict]`
**Purpose**: Feature extraction from binary data
**Removed Because**: Feature extraction belongs in processing pipeline
**Replacement**: Specialized feature extraction agents

### 4. `save_to_database(data: Dict) -> bool`
**Purpose**: Persist data to database
**Removed Because**: Persistence is a separate concern
**Replacement**: Database services handle persistence

### 5. `send_notification(message: str, recipient: str) -> None`
**Purpose**: Send notifications to users
**Removed Because**: Notifications are orthogonal to data reception
**Replacement**: Notification service

### 6. `log_activity(activity: str, level: str) -> None`
**Purpose**: Activity logging
**Removed Because**: Logging should be handled by logging infrastructure
**Replacement**: Centralized logging service

### 7. `validate_input(data: Any) -> bool`
**Purpose**: Input validation
**Removed Because**: Validation logic belongs in validation layer
**Replacement**: API-level validation middleware

### 8. `transform_data(data: Any, format: str) -> Any`
**Purpose**: Data transformation and format conversion
**Removed Because**: Transformation is processing, not reception
**Replacement**: Transformation services in pipeline

### 9. `generate_report(data: Dict) -> str`
**Purpose**: Report generation
**Removed Because**: Reporting is far beyond gateway responsibility
**Replacement**: Reporting services

### 10. `update_metrics(metric: str, value: float) -> None`
**Purpose**: Update system metrics
**Removed Because**: Metrics collection is infrastructure concern
**Replacement**: Metrics/observability system

### 11. `check_health() -> Dict`
**Purpose**: Health check endpoint
**Removed Because**: Health checks belong in API layer
**Replacement**: API health endpoints

### 12. `configure_settings(settings: Dict) -> None`
**Purpose**: Runtime configuration
**Removed Because**: Configuration management is separate concern
**Replacement**: Configuration service

## Current Daedalus Implementation

After cleanup, Daedalus has:
- **1 public method**: `receive_perceptual_information(data: Optional[BinaryIO]) -> Dict[str, Any]`
- **1 private attribute**: `_is_gateway: bool`
- **Single responsibility**: Receive perceptual information from uploads

## Architectural Rationale

### Before (Bloated)
```
Daedalus (God class - 12+ responsibilities)
├── Data Reception
├── Processing
├── Analysis
├── Persistence
├── Notifications
├── Logging
├── Validation
├── Transformation
├── Reporting
├── Metrics
├── Health Checks
└── Configuration
```

### After (Clean)
```
Daedalus (Gateway - 1 responsibility)
└── Data Reception → LangGraph Agents
```

### Benefits of Removal
1. **Single Responsibility**: Daedalus now has one clear purpose
2. **Testability**: Easier to test single method vs 12+ methods
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one concern don't affect Daedalus
4. **Scalability**: Each concern can scale independently
5. **Clarity**: Developer intent is immediately clear

## Migration Guide

### If you need removed functionality:

**Processing/Analysis**: Use LangGraph agents
```python
# Old (removed)
daedalus.process_document(doc)
daedalus.analyze_content(content)

# New
agents = daedalus.receive_perceptual_information(data)
# Agents handle processing
```

**Persistence**: Use database services
```python
# Old (removed)
daedalus.save_to_database(data)

# New
from src.services.database import save_document
save_document(data)
```

**Notifications**: Use notification service
```python
# Old (removed)
daedalus.send_notification(message, recipient)

# New
from src.services.notifications import send_notification
send_notification(message, recipient)
```

**Logging**: Use centralized logging
```python
# Old (removed)
daedalus.log_activity(activity, level)

# New
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info(activity)
```

**Validation**: Use API middleware
```python
# Old (removed)
if daedalus.validate_input(data):
    process(data)

# New - validation happens at API layer
# See: backend/src/api/middleware/validation.py
```

## Test Coverage

Before removal: 12+ methods to test
After removal: 1 method to test

**Test Results**:
- Contract tests: 11/11 passing ✅
- Integration tests: 4/4 passing ✅
- **Total**: 15/15 passing ✅

## Constitution Compliance

✅ **TDD Followed**: Tests written before implementation
✅ **Single Responsibility**: One method, one purpose
✅ **NumPy 2.0+**: N/A for this feature
✅ **Environment Isolation**: Uses existing flux-backend-env
