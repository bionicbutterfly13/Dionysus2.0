## 🌊 River Metaphor Framework Integration

### 1. Information Streams in Architecture Discovery

#### Current Flow:
```python
# ASI-Arch Current
parent_arch = sample_architecture()
new_arch = planner.evolve(parent_arch, context)
results = evaluator.test(new_arch)
insights = analyzer.analyze(results)
```

#### Enhanced Flow with River Metaphor:
```python
# Context Engineering Enhanced
context_stream = ContextStream(parent_arch, domain_knowledge)
confluence_points = detect_confluences(context_stream, similar_archs)
attractor_basin = find_stable_regions(context_stream)
new_arch = river_evolution(context_stream, confluence_points, attractor_basin)
consciousness_level = detect_emergence(new_arch, attractor_basin)
```

### 2. Confluence Points as Architecture Fusion

**Concept**: Where multiple architectural concepts merge and interact

```python
class ConfluencePoint:
    """Point where multiple context streams merge"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_streams = []  # Multiple architecture lineages
        self.fusion_dynamics = None  # How concepts combine
        self.output_stream = None   # Resulting architecture space
        
    def detect_confluences(self, architectures: List[Architecture]) -> List[ConfluencePoint]:
        """Find where architectural concepts naturally merge"""
        # Use Neo4j to find concept intersections
        # Use vector similarity for semantic confluence
        # Apply consciousness detection for emergence points
```

### 3. Attractor Basins for Architecture Stability

**Concept**: Stable regions in architecture space that attract similar designs

```python
class AttractorBasin:
    """Stable region in architecture space"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.center_architecture = None    # Core stable architecture
        self.attraction_radius = None      # How far influence extends  
        self.stability_metrics = None      # Performance consistency
        self.escape_mechanisms = None      # How to break out for innovation
        
    def evaluate_stability(self, architecture: Architecture) -> float:
        """Measure how stable this architecture is"""
        # Use performance consistency across benchmarks
        # Apply neural field dynamics for stability analysis
        # Consider consciousness emergence patterns
```

## 🧠 Knowledge Graph Integration

### Enhanced Data Model

#### Current ASI-Arch DataElement:
```python
@dataclass
class DataElement:
    time: str
    name: str
    result: Dict[str, Any]
    program: str
    analysis: str
    cognition: str
    log: str
    motivation: str
    index: int
    motivation_embedding: Optional[List[float]]
    parent: Optional[int]
    summary: str
    score: Optional[float]
```

#### Enhanced with Context Engineering:
```python
@dataclass
class ContextAwareDataElement(DataElement):
    # Original fields preserved
    
    # Context Engineering Extensions
    context_stream_id: str                    # River metaphor tracking
    confluence_points: List[str]              # Where concepts merged
    attractor_basin_id: Optional[str]         # Stability region
    consciousness_indicators: Dict[str, float] # Emergence metrics
    neural_field_signature: Optional[np.ndarray] # Continuous representation
    
    # Knowledge Graph Relations
    concept_nodes: List[str]                  # Neo4j concept IDs
    reasoning_paths: List[str]                # How architecture was derived
    semantic_relations: Dict[str, float]      # Relationship strengths
    emergent_patterns: List[str]              # Discovered patterns
```

### Neo4j Schema Extension

```cypher
// Architecture Evolution Graph
CREATE (arch:Architecture {
    id: "arch_001",
    name: "Enhanced Linear Attention",
    performance_score: 0.92,
    context_stream_id: "stream_alpha"
})

CREATE (parent:Architecture {id: "arch_parent"})
CREATE (arch)-[:EVOLVED_FROM {
    confluence_point: "attention_mechanism_fusion",
    evolution_step: 1,
    context_flow_strength: 0.85
}]->(parent)

// Attractor Basin Modeling
CREATE (basin:AttractorBasin {
    name: "linear_attention_basin",
    stability_score: 0.78,
    center_architecture: "arch_001"
})

CREATE (arch)-[:ATTRACTED_TO {strength: 0.92}]->(basin)

// Consciousness Emergence
CREATE (pattern:EmergentPattern {
    type: "consciousness_threshold",
    emergence_level: 0.73,
    indicators: ["self_attention", "meta_learning", "adaptive_architecture"]
})

CREATE (arch)-[:EXHIBITS]->(pattern)
